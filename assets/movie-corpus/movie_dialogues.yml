conversations:
- - Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
  - There is -- there is no family.
  - What do you mean there is no family?
  - Liane has filed for divorce...
- - And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
  - Where you staying now?
  - Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
- - I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
  - No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My
    name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
- - Did he hear you?
  - You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
- - What about now?
  - What?
  - Hello, can you hear me now?
- - What's happening?!
  - He doesn't seem to be listening...
  - 'Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words:
    get on the fucking phone...!'
  - I can't say that!
  - No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
- - Who's that?
  - That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
- - How do you like your coffee? Black?
  - Black, black...
- - Look, I really don't have that much time...
  - Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
  - Like what? Your sign?
- - I know what I have to know.
  - Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
  - How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
- - '...but that''s as far as I go...'
  - Far as you go where?
  - This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But
    I can't talk to you about anything else.
- - Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
  - Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take
    that seriously.  Where do you work?
  - Did work.
  - Did work.
  - How much would I get paid?
  - That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this,
    I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
- - Should I just take the documents now?
  - If you want to do it.
- - '...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!'
  - What are you talking about? Where are you?
  - Fuck you, too!
- - Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
  - Jump in, quick, c'mon...
  - I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
- - C'mere. I want to talk to you.
  - Good. I want to talk to you.
- - What do...
  - I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
  - This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
  - To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
  - So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
  - Why am I gonna mention your name?
  - How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
  - How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
  - It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
  - And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head.
    How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with
    information before they provided me with it?
  - You came all the way down here to tell me that?
  - 'No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to
    say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story,
    no story, fuck your story, I don''t burn people.'
- - And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them
    a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign
    it.
  - They're afraid of you, aren't they?
  - They should be.
- - Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
  - Like what?
  - Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
  - Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director
    of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at
    Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
  - I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
- - Seven dwarfs?
  - The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time...
    it was on television...
  - '...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...'
  - It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
  - Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate
    cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You
    go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume.
    Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you
    doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
  - I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive
    effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot.
    I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got
    a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
- - I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with
    it.
  - Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
- - The new place? New.
  - You okay?
- - You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling
    the new house?
  - Good.  You have kids?
- - No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
  - Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk
    to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
  - '...okay.'
  - Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
- - How'd you know that, Lowell?
  - It's obvious, isn't it?
- - Hello. You there
  - Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
  - It's okay.
- - What did you get us?
  - Tempura...
- - The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla
    with Professor... Marcus?
  - Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the
    late '60s... and on me, personally.
  - Next to your father?
  - My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
  - Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
  - You charge by the hour?
  - My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
  - Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious
    man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on
    "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
  - Why?
  - They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got
    to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
  - I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting
    once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed
    out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when
    I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed
    around!
  - I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
  - I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth
    putting on between commercials...
  - '...to a network, probably, we''re all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity.
    What you are is important.'
- - You believe that?
  - No.
  - You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court
    of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
  - You believe that?
  - I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
  - You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
  - Yes.
  - Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify
    having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism?
    Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing.
    And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke,
    alone!
  - Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned
    a source!
  - I don't think you really understand --
  - No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'"
    with this cheap skepticism!
  - I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you
    puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
  - Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I
    been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
- - Excuse me. Yeah...
  - They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
- - Jeff, call the FBI right away...
  - They do this with impunity!
  - Jeff...
  - They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us?
    Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking
    about it.
- - Good. But Jeff...
  - I'll call them, Lowell.
- - Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did
    she think she was coming to New York for?
  - '...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But,
    I really -- I didn''t know how to do that...'
- - Lowell, I can't afford --
  - '...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.'
- - I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
  - I heard.
  - I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to
    Pascagoula to give a deposition...
  - I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
  - Did you have a good day?
- - You attract a crowd.
  - Yeah, great.
  - I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
  - I don't know what to do.
- - What's changed?
  - You mean... since this morning?
  - No. I mean since whenever...
- - '"Part of the reason I''m here is I felt that their representation clearly, at
    least within..."'
  - Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then
    cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs
    all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on
    the B-side...
- - I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say
    it. They do not want to air it.
  - What?!
  - B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean,
    I know how...
  - No.
  - No? No, what?
  - I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for
    my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did...
    the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling
    me is not going to see the light of day.
- - Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media
    expert?
  - What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
- - I told the truth!
  - Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind
    my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover
    everything! Believe me.
- - '...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn''t handle it the right way...'
  - She sued you for back payments of child support?
  - She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the
    complaint...  Any other questions?
- - Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
  - What?
  - Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're
    saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
  - What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team...
    okay?
- - Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
  - ABC...?
  - ABC Telemarketing Company.
  - A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever
    bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat
    a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't
    have any flaws...?
- - That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's.
    They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've
    ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done,
    man. Don't you understand?
  - What does this have to do with my testimony?
  - That's not the point.
  - What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and
    true and provable!
  - That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
  - I told the truth... I told the truth.
- - I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
  - And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The
    Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
- - You manipulated me into this...!
  - That's bullshit, Jeff!
  - You greased the rails!
  - I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes.
    Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't
    you?
  - '"Up to you, Jeffrey. That''s the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information
    the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met
    a source he couldn''t turn around.'
  - I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
  - You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring
    at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's
    the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
  - Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to
    a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
- - Where are you, anyway?
  - I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
  - You try and have a good time.
  - Yeah. Yeah, I will.
- - Coffee?
  - Yeah... Thank you.
  - How have you liked your stay?
  - What I've seen... I've liked.
- - Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American
    media?
  - Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now.
    So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment
    in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
- - Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I
    decide if I grant the interview.
  - No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know
    our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated,
    most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
- - Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
  - That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know
    it sounds odd... but...
- - We're there.
  - Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
  - Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you
    mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
- - '...come in earlier on Mike''s Marine barracks line when he''s talking to Sheikh
    Mussawi...'
  - You eating with us?
  - Yeah.
  - Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
- - He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
  - What "Seven Dwarfs?"
  - The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid
    of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does
    this guy have to say that threatens these people?
- - Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
  - Hardly new news.
  - No shit.
  - What's this?
- - Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
  - What do you mean?
  - We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
  - Oh, torture? Great ratings.
- - So, is everything okay?
  - How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- - Thank you for saying that...
  - Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can
    get it out of the way and order...
  - Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired.
    And others will deal...
- - Oh, man.
  - Who are these people?
  - Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect?
    Grace and consistency?
- - It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
  - Good.
- - I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is
    a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have
    to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
  - After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy
    show.  Anything else?
- - I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse
    Corporation.
  - What?
- - Lowell.
  - '"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!'
  - Lowell.
  - These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
  - Lowell!
  - What?
  - I'm with Don on this.
- - I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
  - I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to
    see everything on Sunday night...
  - I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
  - Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What
    do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer
    is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness
    of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
- - Yeah.
  - You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
  - I disappeared on you?
  - Alright. What did you think?
  - I think it was a disgrace.
- - Did I get you up?
  - No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning,
    sleepy look on my face.
- - How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
  - Oh, lots.
  - Yeah, that's right.
  - But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and
    find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on
    us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
  - I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
  - I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something,
    I deliver.
  - Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down
    the shining path. To show me the way.
  - Oh, please, Mike...
  - Give me a break!
  - No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned.
    Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact.
    I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're
    supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie
    down? Back off? What, get over it?
  - In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
  - Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
  - 'I''m not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I''m talking about when you''re nearer
    the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about
    then? The future? "In the future I''m going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"?
    No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I''m gone.'
- - Mike... in my...
  - You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
- - That Canada story? Still interest you?
  - Everything interests me.
- - C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
  - I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll
    be fine... maybe?
- - Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
  - Alright.
  - Area code 212-555-0199.
  - I'll call you then.
- - '...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi,
    did you not?'
  - That's right...
  - Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown
    & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
  - What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
  - Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed
    up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement
    and give him some protection.
- - Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for
    three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers,
    so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is
    your man truly committed?
  - Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
- - Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing
    what he's going to do...
  - Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want
    to do it?
  - It would be better if he called us.
  - Yeah.
  - Alright?
  - Okay. Thank you.
- - Yeah, I'm here.
  - What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
- - '...I''d be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court
    of public opinion...'
  - '...and I''d be lying to you if I didn''t tell you, I''m about out of moves, Dick...'
  - All right. See you...
- - Yeah...
  - '...you fucked me!'
  - Who is this?
- - Is it too late?
  - No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
- - Oh, my God.
  - You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
  - Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in
    a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything
    you say!
- - Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
  - It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
  - Let me call you back...
- - No classes this morning?
  - Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
- - Will independent sources corroborate that?
  - Hello? Yeah...
- - Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
  - I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
- - Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
  - '..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?'
- - '...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who''s this from?'
  - '...it''s anonymous. References to "P.M."  It''s got to be Philip Morris, huh?'
  - I have to take a shower.
- - What's wrong?
  - They're killing the Wigand interview...
  - What?!
  - They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
  - What are you and Mike going to do?
  - I'm alone on this...
  - Oh, baby...
- - Jeffrey Wigand...
  - Jeffrey...
- - '"I''m Lowell Bergman, I''m from ''60 Minutes.''" You know, you take the "60 Minutes"
    out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand''s right. Maybe
    I''m hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment.
    It''s so fucking useless, all of it.'
  - So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
  - Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
  - Get some perspective, Lowell.
  - I got perspective.
  - No, you do not.
  - From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous.
    It's half-measures.
  - You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
- - Thank you, Bob.
  - Who's calling?
  - My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
  - Did you say Berman?
  - No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
  - '"60 Minutes"?'
  - Yeah.
  - '"60 Minutes," the television show?'
  - Yes.
- - I can take her.
  - Don't you have to be at the office?
  - Is there any more rice...?
  - Yes, it's on the stove...
- - I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
  - Try the car.
- - Uh, what are those boxes?
  - I'm going to the store. You need anything?
  - What do you need at the store?
  - Soy sauce...
  - Right now?
  - That's my stuff from the office...
  - Why did you take your stuff from the office?
  - I didn't want to leave it there...
  - I don't understand.
  - I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
  - Why? Who said?
  - Thomas Sandefur...
  - What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our
    health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
- - There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing
    medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
  - No, thank you.
- - What's going on?
  - I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the
    "F" up, they were going to kill you...
- - '...taping?  What are you taping?'
  - I'm doing an interview.
  - An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
- - Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
  - Where should I wash them?
  - Use the bathroom.
  - What's the difference...
  - That's for food.
- - I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey.
    But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
  - Can we talk about this when I get back?
  - Yes... Jeffrey.
- - Hello?
  - Jim, it's Lowell.
- - Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
  - Okay.  Lowell?
  - Yeah?
  - You're sure you want to do this?
  - Why?
  - Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
  - You ready...?
  - Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate
    decision?
- - Lowell?
  - Did I tell you you were wrong?
  - No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco.
    Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
- - Hey, Lowell.
  - How are you, Jim?
  - Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
- - Hi, baby.
  - Catch you later.
- - How prominent? What kind of placement?
  - Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
  - Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not
    air an interview.
  - Call me back in ten.
- - What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
  - I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
  - No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
  - And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
  - His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
  - Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard...
    for everyone else...
- - Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
  - Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater
    the damage.
  - Come again?
  - They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage
    to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are
    smaller.
  - Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
- - Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
  - You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll
    find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
- - Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
  - No, no, we're fine...
  - Are you sure?
- - If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired
    this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave
    risk.
  - How grave?
  - Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson
    Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
- - Mike... Mike... Mike...
  - '"Mike?"'
- - Debbie...
  - Hey, Lowell.
- - Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco
    dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
  - What about you, you got a crew already?
  - I'm gonna do a follow-up.
  - Okay.
  - Catch ya' later.
- - Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
  - Yes, I'm afraid I did.
- - A gun? Yes.
  - What caliber is your gun?
  - What caliber is my gun?
  - Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
  - What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
- - You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
  - If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
- - That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
  - Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22
    target pistol. So what?
  - Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
  - Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my
    mailbox...!
- - You can't take that... It's personal property...!
  - We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
  - '...my files! Personal correspondence...'
- - That computer has everything...
  - You alright, Mr. Wigand?
- - There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should
    cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
  - So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all
    that crap?
  - That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should
    have it in the can.
  - I'm not touching my film...
  - I'm afraid you are.
  - No, I'm not...
  - We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another
    producer to edit your show...
- - So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his
    chair again.  As they start to leave...
  - Before you go...
- - And what are you implying?
  - I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit
    From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million.
    Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
- - I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
  - Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the
    world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones
    with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
- - '"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.'
  - Lunch?
- - Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine
    the news content on "60 Minutes"?
  - It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't
    think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
- - Yeah, I heard rumors.
  - It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse
    and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown
    & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
- - Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
  - Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you
    are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
  - CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
  - No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference."
    I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to
    Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders.
    And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
  - You're exaggerating!
  - I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust
    us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He
    violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness
    in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance
    case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television
    and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course
    not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth.
    That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it
    gets!
  - You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show,
    then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be
    satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
  - C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because
    that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
- - So, what are you going to do?
  - Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do
    that.
  - You're taking "no" for an answer?
  - No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
  - Then what are you going to do?
- - I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You
    don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
  - End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't
    think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being
    prepared.
- - What the hell are you doing?
  - What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
  - No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that
    we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that
    we were lying?
  - No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this
    segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut
    up for you. Not on any of it.
  - Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
- - The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors!
    You fucked us!
  - No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you
    bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist
    sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character
    assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our
    show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the
    State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here
    debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
- - Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
  - '...if you are, then I''ll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...'
- - Do you want more rice?
  - Maybe later.
  - How about you?
- - What are you cooking?
  - I'm cooking pasta primavera.
  - Oh, I love that stuff.
- - I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries
    of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
  - Okay.
- - What does that do?
  - What do you mean, what's it do?
  - What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
  - Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's
    no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out
    in the world...
- - Shit...
  - Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
  - I don't know what he was thinking.
  - Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
  - Alright, alright.
  - Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
- - When's the air date?
  - Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
  - Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
- - What was that about?
  - Get me Wigand.
  - Sure.
  - '...fuck is this? Fuck!'
- - I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen,
    could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
  - Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
- - Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking
    for you...
  - Good.
  - The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief
    Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized
    smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
- - Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
  - You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
  - We gotta hook up.
  - Sure. Where?
  - P.J.'s.
  - I'll be there.
- - When's your deadline?
  - Monday.
  - Push it.
  - What? Forget it.
  - It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
  - It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
  - Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone
    book.
  - Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
  - And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation
    behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
  - I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you
    say so.
- - Are you all right?
  - Yeah. Catch you later.
- - These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
  - Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
  - Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different
    story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
- - Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two
    agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening
    to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright?
    When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
  - 'You better take a good look! Because I''m getting two things: pissed off and
    curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after
    they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs?
    Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who''s already at Brown & Williamson
    as we fucking speak?'
- - Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed
    up...?
  - Lowell?
- - We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
  - How long?
  - Three hours.
  - You got a deal.
- - He's into kind of little cars, that...
  - That remote control thing?
  - Yeah.
  - Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
  - Mom.
  - Yes, baby?
  - There's Dad, on TV.
- - Hi, honey.
  - Hi, Daddy.
  - What's new?
  - Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
  - Yeah? What for?
  - For reading.
- - That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
  - Okay.
- - Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
  - She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
- - Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
  - She was playing with the Pooh doll.
  - Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's
    -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't
    breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like
    branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we
    give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't
    you?
- - I'll take some.
  - Instant rice...?
  - Can I go over to Janeane's house?
- - Hey, baby. What's wrong?
  - What's that outside, Daddy?
  - Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
  - I heard them.
  - Where?
  - In the backyard.
- - Screw the PEM...What about Al...
  - Poor bastard.
- - What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
  - What does he know?
  - Too much.
- - Look, nobody knows we did it.
  - Whoever took it does.
- - It'l take months.
  - So we better get started.
  - What about Al...
- - Right there.
  - Thank you.
- - This the only spare?
  - Yes.
  - The other working.
  - Perfectly.
- - Ow?...
  - It'l be alright.
  - It will.
  - It doesn't hurt.
  - No?
- - Wait.
  - Why?
  - You can't take that.
  - Why not?
  - The experiment. The danger...
- - It's alright.
  - It is?
  - It will be fine. You have another.
  - Just one. The back up.
  - Could I have it, please.
  - I can't get it out. It would take hours.
  - That's alright. Just tear it apart.
  - Tear it apart?
  - Yes.
  - Ahhh...Okay?!!!
- - Mom...what are you doing here?
  - Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
- - Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
  - I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll
    just have a seat.
  - I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
  - '...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?'
- - Is there anything else?
  - A drink...
  - Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
  - Thanks.
- - Must be a fulfilling occupation.
  - It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
- - What could you find in this place?
  - '...Piece of mind.'
- - Excuse me?
  - Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is
    it?
- - I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
  - Why are you on to him?
  - We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going
    down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any
    moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
  - Why'd you invite me here?
  - Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's
    not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
  - What about the others.
  - I don't know.
- - What do you do about what?
  - '...I''m looking for someone.'
- - Is someone else here?
  - No. No one to speak of.
  - I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
- - '...Blake'
  - Blake?
  - The poet...something he said...
  - Yes?
- - Blake said that?
  - Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
- - I'll be right there.
  - Where?
  - Dinner...tonight.
  - Oh...I can't. Business.
- - And you.
  - '...right here too.'
  - Haven't seen you around.
- - I can't do that?
  - Do what?
  - Let you leave without it.
  - Without what?
- - What's so funny?
  - Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
  - What way?
  - Like there's someone else here.
- - Wait. What's your name?
  - '...Rene.'
- - You mean from it.
  - Yes, of course.
- - And you?
  - I just work for the travel firm.
- - You again.
  - Me still. They left you alone?
  - I waited for you.
  - Why?
  - '...I...don''t know.'
- - I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
  - It's not apparent.
  - '...and sort of...disinterest.'
  - Disinterest?
  - As if your mind's not all there.
  - I am sort of scattered.
  - Can I help?
  - You are.
  - Are you alright?
- - Promise you what?
  - That you're not crazy.
  - I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know.
    Why do you ask?
  - You talk to yourself.
  - But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
  - Why do you do it?
  - If I was with you, I wouldn't
  - You did.
  - That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
  - You're talking to me.
  - And how'm I doing?
  - You're doing...Okay.
  - Just Okay...
- - '...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?'
  - '...Naw. Made that up.'
  - Who do you work for?
  - No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
  - Trans Ocean Travel.
  - Is that Ryuji?
  - No. Ryuji just hires us.
  - Hires you for what?
  - To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
  - How often they come here?
  - He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
  - And you, what do you like?
  - That depends...
- - Joe! What happened to you?
  - Why'd you run off?
- - Why did you leave?
  - They left. I had to go with them.
  - Why didn't you tell me?
- - Why did you stay with me?
  - Wanted to get to know you.
  - Why?
  - You seemed interesting.
  - Who else is interested in me?
  - What do you mean?
  - Your friends, did they ask about me?
  - They kidded me a little.
  - What did you tell them?
  - There's not much to tell.
  - Why did they leave?
  - I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
  - You work for Ryuji?
  - Sometimes. I told you I did.
  - Were you working for him last night?
  - Last night?
  - Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
  - No, he didn't do that.
  - He didn't.
  - No.
  - Who did?
  - You did.
- - I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
  - This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
- - You're leaving.
  - Food doesn't agree with me.
  - I'm leaving too.
  - Why?
  - This business is over.
  - I'm sorry. What will you do?
  - Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
  - I'm just on vacation.
  - Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
- - You know where he went?
  - What's he done?
  - He stole something. From a friend of mine.
  - He must be a good friend.
  - We're very close.
  - What'd he steal?
  - A chip. Goes in a computer.
  - One chip?
  - The most important one. Can you help me find him?
  - How do you know you can trust me?
  - Got to trust someone.
- - I don't know. He mentioned a city.
  - What is it?
  - Hiroshima.
  - Get your things.
- - You don't believe me.
  - Oh sure.
  - Then why are you smiling like that?
  - Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs
    and things...running around, acting mysterious.
  - You think I'm like that?
- - What's Gruner like?
  - They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about
    something.
  - Who was?
  - Ryuji and Gruner.
  - And Dieter.
  - Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
  - And you?
  - It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires
    me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
- - Where we going?
  - Beats me.
- - This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
  - Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
  - Then where's the chip.
- - What?
  - He plays it all the time.
- - Now what?
  - We figure out if it's in here.
  - How?
  - Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
- - That must be him. Water taxi.
  - Get us one.
  - Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
- - Where what?
  - Where would you go to sell a chip?
- - If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
  - Hong Kong.
  - What?
  - Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
- - Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
  - I asked him.
  - Oh.
- - Why'd you ask him.
  - He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous
    photographer. He makes millions.
  - Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
- - What?
  - I said just relax. I'm in full control.
- - Chiang Cho?
  - '...across THE BORDER. Come on!'
  - That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
  - You've  been there?
  - I know the territory.
  - You coming along?
- - So do I.
  - This going to work?
  - Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
  - He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
- - Why not?
  - Can you?
  - Sure I can, can't I?
- - What happened?
  - I can't fly it.
  - What'd...you forget?
- - Are you alright?
  - Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
  - Looks like they can. What did they do?
  - They asked about you.
  - What did you tell them?
  - That I really don't know.
  - Now what?
  - They'll listen to what we say in here.
- - What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
  - Why?
- - What a mess.
  - You can say that again. What do we do?
  - Nothing we can do.
- - What?
  - They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
  - Can't you do something?
- - I'm sorry I got you into this.
  - It was my choice.
- - Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
  - Why did you, then?
  - For you.
- - I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
  - I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what
    she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll
    be glad to call you my friend.
- - How?
  - What?
- - Now what?
  - I've never met anyone like you.
- - Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
  - I love you too.
- - Don't worry.
  - Why not, what are you going to do?
  - Escape.
- - Just like that?
  - I'll come back for you.
  - Aren't you a little optimistic?
- - You son of a bitch! You conned me!
  - You're gonna laugh.
- - Kiss her you fool.
  - Her?
- - Who are you? Who do you work for?
  - Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
  - I knew it. I told him.
  - Now what?
  - We just don't stop.
- - He can't help us.
  - Do something!
  - Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
  - You are, I've seen you.
  - It wasn't me. It was him.
  - It was you.
  - He told me what to do.
  - But you did it. It was you.
- - It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
  - If he was able, what would he say.
- - Come on.
  - That's twenty feet high.
  - Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
- - Riuji?
  - I told you, I work for him.
- - What is it?
  - We're not moving fast enough for him.
- - He wants to apologise.
  - He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
  - Yeah...I have to get away.
  - I know a nice island.
- - Yes...What is it?
  - What's what?
  - What do you want?
  - Nothing.
  - What did you say?
  - Nothing.
  - What?
  - I said...I didn't say..anything!
  - Then who did?
  - You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
- - Oh...and who is it!?
  - I didn't say anything.
- - How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
  - Sir?
- - How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
  - We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
  - This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
- - Now you know what I know.
  - Sir?
- - About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
  - Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
- - The fresh tuna?..
  - Yessir...very good sir.
- - That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
  - I noticed you staring.
  - Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
- - And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
  - A little voice in my head.
- - You may you find all the solitude you want.
  - Thanks, I appreciate that.
- - Don't do it!
  - Just give me the keys.
  - Whatever it is, don't do it.
- - Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
  - What?
  - Your memory.
  - What about it?
  - It may have been affected.
  - Oh.
  - You may not remember things.
  - What things?
  - I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
  - Oh...that's okay.
  - When you do...
  - Do what?
  - When you remember...
  - Remember what?
  - Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
  - Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
  - Right.
  - Who...are you?
  - Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
  - How do I look?
  - Fine. You look fine.
  - Thanks.
  - Well...
  - Well what?
  - We're here.
  - Here?
  - Home. Your home. The address on your form.
  - Oh.
  - Don't you want to get out?
  - Oh....Sure.
  - Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
  - I feel fine.
  - You'll feel better
  - I will?
  - Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off.
    You need anything, just call this number.
- - Joe.
  - What?
  - Take the card.
  - Oh yeah, thanks...
- - Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
  - No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
  - Why would we want to hurt you?
  - Not you. Them.
  - Who?
  - I don't know Who.
- - Al?
  - The little man in my...  ...head...
- - I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
  - Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
- - Ahhh...nothing.
  - Been complaning of hallucinations.
  - Not...complaining, actually.
  - Been hearing voices.
- - Was quite excited, when he came in...
  - Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry
    about...just be my old self again....soon...
- - Sue who?
  - You...him...UST.
- - I don't want to intrude.
  - We insist.
- - Al Viola.
  - That name's familiar.
  - It is to me too.
  - You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
- - '...Foreign service.'
  - And how do you service foreigners.
  - Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
- - What brings you here?
  - I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
- - And...you know Jan Gruner?
  - I think I've heard of you.
- - Who is your friend?
  - We met on the beach.
  - Join us.
- - What are you doing here, where've you been?
  - I have a new client.
  - That crazy guy?
  - Yes. Joe.
- - Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
  - It's just money.
  - Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
- - Yes?
  - He's not an ordinary man.
  - Enough ROmance.
  - He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
- - Surveillance Cameras?
  - They took the tapes.
  - You have nothing...
  - We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with
    them?
- - We'll have to let them go.
  - Surveilliance on them all.
- - Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
  - He work for us?
  - Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
- - What Job?
  - Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
  - Sir?
  - Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
  - Bit expensive, sir.
  - It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
- - You didn't tell us you were coming?
  - Then how did you know?
- - You've cut your hair?
  - I dyed it. We're all getting old.
- - PEM115!
  - '**?!!'
  - Newer, more powerful design.
- - How about a deal?
  - We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
- - I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
  - Rene?
  - She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
- - Impossible.
  - I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it
    down, and then...inject him.
- - If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
  - Who's our little man?
  - Me.
  - No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
  - I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
- - What happened?
  - Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
  - In him?
  - It's a long story.
  - ya hyutn slulptsa?
- - They have stolen state property.
  - What a nerve!
- - Not that truth!
  - Aren't we all.
- - Sorry...
  - It'll remind me of you.
  - Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
- - Doesn't matter.
  - What part what?
  - The best part. She'll love it.
- - I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
  - Do what? What'd you do?
- - What is your name?
  - Don't give her your name.
- - No!
  - Oh, I can't.
  - Good.
- - We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
  - Dieter?
- - I'm against it.
  - I insist.
- - Can you fly this?
  - Don't worry.
- - I'm...scared.
  - Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
- - I didn't do anything.
  - I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have
    dealt with this.
- - Nice?
  - In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
- - What kind of a deal?
  - Let us get to the border!
  - Then what?
- - I knew you were trouble.
  - Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
- - JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
  - GO-TOE. It's some islands.
  - JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
  - It's all we've got.
- - JOE What abilities...?
  - Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you,
    the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
- - I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
  - JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information.
    Now, get off my back!
  - Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
- - You just got a Mickey.
  - RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
- - I said something.
  - I know you did!
- - No, not her. Me.
  - Who's you?
- - My name is AL.
  - Al ???!!!
- - Where are you,...Al?
  - You're not gonna believe this...
  - Try me.
  - I'm...inside you.
- - I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
  - What's going on?
- - '...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus'
  - Don't do that.
  - Why not.
- - Arrrgh!
  - It wasn't him.
  - Who was it?
  - Me.
  - Who?
  - Al.
- - Al.
  - Yes?
  - This candid camera?
- - You're in my head...
  - Yes.
  - Your name is Al...
  - Yes.
  - I see...
- - No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window
    breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
  - What is your name?
  - You're in my head? You don't know my name?
  - I just got here.
  - What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
  - Where are we?
  - Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking
    to ourselves. People are staring at us.
  - What street?
  - What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're
    about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
  - Why don't we go home?
  - Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
  - '...I need to make a phone call.'
  - Do me a favor, Al.
  - Yeah?
  - Shut up!
- - Somebody's been here.
  - Where are we now?
  - My place, can't you see?
  - No.
  - You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
  - Right.
  - Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
  - I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
  - Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where
    they are.
- - Who are you?
  - Who am I?
  - Yeah...Who?
  - Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
- - Quit screwing around, this is important.
  - It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
  - I told you, my name is Al.
  - What are you doing in my head, Al?
- - You've heard of the PEM114...
  - That a new Datsun?
- - Are you threatening me?
  - I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
- - Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
  - Me? What'd I do?
  - Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in
    my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
  - I don't know what you're talking about.
  - The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
  - No.
  - You've heard of U.S.T.?
  - I just went there for a job.
  - Then how'd I get here?
- - I know...it sounds insane.
  - You said it.
- - What are you doing?
  - Loading a gun.
  - What for?
  - Kill myself.
  - Are you crazy?
  - Yep.
  - Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
  - Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and
    I'm crazy too.
  - You're not crazy.
  - Hear voices don't I.
  - Of course you do!
  - Then I'm crazy.
- - You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
  - You're gonna explain.
  - Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
  - Yeah.
  - Why he's argumentative?
  - Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
- - You'll be alive.
  - With a man in my head...
  - Yeah.
- - What was that?
  - Who was that? Somebody out there?
- - You weren't listening!
  - Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
  - Why don't you?
- - No they won't.
  - Why not?
  - I'll talk to them.
  - Oh...Gooood!
  - I'll tell you what to say.
  - If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
  - If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll
    be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
- - Anyone there?
  - No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
- - Behind us?
  - Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
- - What's that?
  - Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
- - What'd he look like?
  - He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
- - What do I do?
  - Outrun them.
  - This is a Fiesta!
- - Now what?
  - Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
- - I wouldn't say that.
  - Then what are you stopping for?
- - Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
  - Can't see a Goddamn thi..
- - I want out.
  - Too late...They want you.
  - Why? AL  You know too much.
  - I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
  - You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
- - Calm Down! Act rational.
  - How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
- - I don't know...To get Al.
  - No. Don't tell the guards.
- - Did you hear that?
  - Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
- - It can't take that long.
  - Why?
- - JOE Or what?
  - I don't know. I don't want to find out.
- - They could put you back in the tube..
  - I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no
    chance.
  - Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
  - They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
  - Yeah...Who is?
  - I am. You are.
  - You are CRAZY!
  - You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on
    our own.
  - What do you mean we.
  - You gotta help.
  - I did. I brought you back here.
  - We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
  - Thanks.
  - Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
  - I'm not leaving until you do.
- - Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
  - Find You?
  - I'm not gonna make it easy.
- - They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
  - Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
- - Sue them.
  - I'll sue.
- - I don't like the sound of that.
  - We have to get out of here.
  - Door's locked.
  - See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
- - Now what.
  - Go out, take your first left.
  - Just walk down the hall?
  - With Authority!
- - Which way do I go?
  - What does it say.
  - Corridor A.
  - Take a left and your next right.
  - Where are we going?
- - A lab and equipment.
  - Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
  - I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
  - Who did?
  - The man.
- - Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
  - I can't remember..
- - Like the guys that attacked us.
  - What do you mean?
  - Black suits and helmets.
  - That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
  - That's not a good idea.
  - They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
  - Gone where?
  - Don't know.
- - You need ID in there?
  - You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
  - I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
  - You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us
    away.
- - Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
  - Nothing!
- - Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
  - Just scratched my arm, why?
  - I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
  - The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
- - I'm back.
  - I'm at the airport.
  - Good. Get to a phone.
- - Who is it?
  - Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
- - Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
  - What am I supposed to do?
  - Nothing. You just do nothing.
- - What is it?
  - Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
- - What do we do?
  - Send a man there. A secret agent.
  - Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
  - You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
- - You mean...just leave.
  - We get on a plane.
  - We get on which plane?
- - What about money?
  - What about it?
  - I don't have any.
  - Use my credit cards.
  - I can't do that.
  - Why not?
  - It's illegal.
  - Who cares?
  - I'll get in trouble.
  - You are in trouble. Now do it.
- - '...and a license to kill...'
  - Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
- - They'll know who I am.
  - We'll change your appearance.
- - It's just not enough.
  - It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
  - What's wrong with how I carry myself.
  - Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
  - Oh yeah, to what?
  - You'll be me.
  - I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
  - Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
  - You leave my glands alone!
- - Now what?
  - The beach.
  - The beach?
  - How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
  - Eating sushi?
  - Just get there.
- - Holy shit!
  - What is it?
  - '...Just beautiful.'
- - Do you notice anything.
  - The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
  - Swim.
  - Good Idea!
- - Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
  - Little late for that.
- - Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
  - You eat it.
  - You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
  - I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
- - Now what?
  - The sand.
  - Eat it?
  - Eat it.
  - I don't want to eat it.
  - Why not?
  - It's sand.
  - For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating
    around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
- - Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
  - Where are you going? Wait!
- - Al, are you doing anything in there?
  - What? What do you mean?
  - Are you screwing with any nerves?
- - Beautiful!
  - What was?
  - A girl.
- - This must be business, there's nothing else here.
  - Follow it.
- - She's...pretty fast.
  - You're out of shape.
- - What is it?
  - She's beautiful...! What do I do?
- - You're beautiful..
  - What's happening?
  - She doesn't seem to understand.
  - Try another language.
  - Which language?
  - How should I know?
- - Help me out, will you?
  - What can I do? You're on your own.
- - What do I do?
  - Don't just stand there, say something.
  - What?
  - Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
- - .
  - .
- - Wait.
  - Wait.
- - Where is she staying?
  - Where are you staying?
- - Touch her.
  - What?
  - Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
- - '...Joe.'
  - No...you idiot!
- - What happened?
  - '...Rene...'
- - Where are you going?
  - To the hotel. To register.
  - Without your pants.
  - Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
- - Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
  - Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
  - It worked.
  - I made it work.
  - You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some
    stumblebum.
  - Rene...
  - I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up
    girls.
  - Well you did it today.
  - Yeah. I did it.
  - But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
- - Now, where would I be?
  - What are you looking at?
- - But what's it look like?
  - What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
  - Is something glinting?
- - What is it?
  - Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
- - You really like that shirt?
  - This...is not going to work out.
- - Much too blue.
  - Not blue enough.
- - Mind your own business.
  - It is my business. It's my name.
  - But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
- - Not that tie with that coat.
  - Why not?!
- - What did that cost?
  - You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
  - Doesn't.
- - Which one is she?
  - The beautiful one.
- - They both look good to me.
  - You have no taste.
- - Get close to them.
  - That place. By the window.
- - You're not just after this girl, are you?
  - Who, me?
- - You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
  - Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
  - That's a big if.
- - Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
  - What glasses.
  - The drinks...Stay on them.
- - Follow that busboy.
  - Are you serious?
- - I feel like an idiot.
  - Just hold them close and stay still.
- - Which one?
  - The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
  - Killer!
- - Just don't show fear.
  - I don't know what's going on.
  - It lends you an air of mystery.
- - He recognises you, throw him off.
  - My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton
    Place.
  - Don't get too cute.
- - Joe, be careful!
  - '...I''ve lost something. I must get it back.'
- - They're all in it.
  - How do you know?
  - Voice stress analyzer.
  - Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
- - Even Rene?
  - She's the toughest to read.
  - Maybe she's telling the truth.
  - Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you
    don't want to know.
  - Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed.
    We might as well go with instinct...
- - What is it, your charm?
  - This just won't work.
  - You're doing great with her.
  - Not her. You!
  - What is it?
  - You can't listen. You can't watch either.
- - It's embarrassing.
  - What if she says something important?
  - I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without
    you butting in.
  - What am I supposed to do?
  - You got any books in there?
  - Oh come on.
  - You shut down your sensors.
  - Joe! It's 56 hours!
  - I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean
    it.
- - What Happened?
  - I don't know!
  - What she say. What'd you get out of her?
- - Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University
    of Tokyo..
  - Is that all?
  - Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
- - She's got the most beautiful...s
  - Shit! You're in love.
- - And on my time.
  - It's not your time. I get time off.
  - You get time off to sleep.
- - No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small,
    and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me.
    And you know what I'll do?
  - No. What will you do.
  - I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
- - You been had. We have.
  - It wasn't like that.
- - Some agent you are.
  - Why don't you get out of my face.
- - Bingo.
  - You found her.
  - Better. I found Ryuji.
  - That's good. It's not better. Where?
  - Osaka.
  - Osaka?
  - Fountainhead of High-Tech.
- - Don't you think I stand out like this.
  - We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come
    to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present
    itself.
  - I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their
    language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to
    present itse........
- - What do I do?
  - Follow her.
  - On what?
  - Run, stupid!
- - Come on, she's getting away.
  - I can't keep up.
- - Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
  - That's not funny.
- - Sapporo..
  - Just stay here and rest.
  - Where are you going?
  - Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
  - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
- - '`Joe. I''m here. You''re Okay.'
  - What do I do?
  - Relax. Let me do this.
- - Relax. Make your mind a blank.
  - It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
- - What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
  - You think. That's what you're good at.
- - Yeah...You've fallen for her.
  - I told you, I have a feeling...
  - One of your instincts?
  - I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't
    her.
- - Don't touch a thing.
  - Don't worry!
- - '...drink it.'
  - Too late.
- - What next!
  - Drink lots of water.
- - I can't...
  - You have to! Quickly!
  - '...imagine a better grape for the region.'
- - What are you doing?
  - Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and
    ----.
- - Ow!
  - A hard left. A hard left.
- - Door to the right. Get up and run.
  - I can't see a thing.
  - Neither can they.
- - What?
  - Never mind, just say it.
  - ''
- - He was with Gruner!
  - You were with GRUNER!
- - I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
  - No. You can't trust her.
- - Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
  - Probably.
  - I don't trust her.
  - Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
- - It's him.
  - Come on.
- - Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
  - I've got an idea.
  - I was afraid of that.
- - You sure this will work?
  - Not sure at all.
  - Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
  - Just say the words. Just like I told you.
- - What was it? What'd I say?
  - You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
- - haka xuki.
  - haka xuki. What's that mean?
  - Cash.
- - Left...The one with the red dot.
  - Well...?
  - It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
- - He hung us up dry.
  - While he makes the run.
  - Where?
- - It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into
    Hong Kong.
  - And Dieter?
  - He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
- - Then, why'd he lead us here.
  - He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people
    busy. We were too fast for him.
- - Do it.
  - I can't handle that thing.
  - Don't worry, I can.
- - Are you alright?
  - Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
- - Aim just in front of his face.
  - Aim what?
- - Holy...
  - '...Shit! It''s just money.'
- - He aready made the deal..
  - The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
  - Dieter!
  - GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to
    Chiang Cho.
- - There's a lot you don't know.
  - And don't let her know, either.
- - This may hurt.
  - Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
- - Pretty advanced, isn't it?
  - Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they
    need is the chip.
- - Do something.
  - What exactly?
  - I don't know.
- - What happened?
  - Losing power. The laser drained it.
- - Be quiet.
  - Where've you been?
  - Never mind that, where are we now.
  - We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
  - Gimme a minute.
  - Looks like you can have all you want.
- - I can always flush you down the toilet.
  - Keep thinking.
  - I have been... I think you're right.
  - About what?
  - Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring
    me here.
  - Rene?
  - She works for them.
  - Now, you're too suspicious.
  - You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
  - I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
  - No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
- - She is beautiful.
  - You've changed your mind.
- - Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
  - Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
  - Oh no!
- - I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
  - She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
  - They can?
- - You're a lucky man.
  - Yeah, sure.
- - She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
  - You're lovely.
- - I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
  - I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
  - I want to thank you for what you've done.
- - Awwww...
  - I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've
    said about you.
- - Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us
    a way out.
  - I'll get us out of here.
  - Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
- - In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
  - That's nice.
- - What are you doing?
  - Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
- - I get it!
  - You got it!
- - This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
  - They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
  - Figures...
  - They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
- - Give me your hat...
  - What for?
  - I'm going to puke in it...
- - I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
  - Willie, come on!
- - I like the service here.
  - Hey, he's not a waiter...
  - No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the
    antidote on the table, Lao.
- - Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
  - Who cares? Where's that diamond!
- - For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
  - Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
- - Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
  - Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
- - You don't look very good.
  - Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang
    Poo bridge!
- - What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
  - The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
- - I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
  - Siam.
  - Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
- - So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
  - Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a
    rest? Okay, doll?
- - I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that
    nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
  - Oh yeah?
- - Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
  - Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
- - You all right?
  - No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress.
    Where are we anyway?
- - India...
  - Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
- - What'd he say?
  - He told me they knew I was coming here.
  - What do you mean -- how?
  - The old man saw it in a dream.
  - Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
  - He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall
    down.
- - God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
  - That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
- - Took what?
  - It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
- - And then they took their children.
  - Their children?
- - What'd he say now?
  - It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
- - Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
  - Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very
    primitive approach.
  - Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over
    to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
  - Somehow I feel safer in here.
- - Indy! Help me!
  - Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
  - A snake!
- - A what...?
  - A SNAKE!!
- - Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
  - Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
  - What?!
  - First of all -- don't panic!
- - Don't let it pull you deeper!
  - It's pulling me deeper!
  - Don't let it curl around you!
  - It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
- - Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
  - What?!
  - Can you move your arm?
  - Just one arm!
  - Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
  - PET IT??!!
  - Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
  - THE WHAT?!
  - Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
- - Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
  - Keep stroking it!
- - What's happening?
  - It's starting to let go!
  - That's good -- you're doing fine.
- - Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
  - I know the feeling...
- - Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
  - I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
- - Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
  - He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
- - By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
  - Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced
    me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
- - What about the future?
  - Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
- - I'd like to find one of those myself.
  - Oh really?
  - Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune
    and glory...
  - Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
  - Maybe...
- - The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
  - What does the writing say?
  - It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met
    the Hindu god Shiva.
  - That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
  - Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him
    five sacred stones that had magical powers.
  - You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
- - I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
  - I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
- - Couldn't keep away, huh?
  - Just try and control yourself.
- - He's afraid of something.
  - He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
  - You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
- - Any more complaints?
  - Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
- - I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
  - She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
- - That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
  - Maybe he likes older women.
- - Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
  - I've never been so hungry in my life...
- - Not leftovers?
  - No -- real food.
- - You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace
    slave?
  - Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
- - Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
  - I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
- - Primitive sexual practices?
  - You're talking to an authority in that area.
- - You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
  - You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
  - Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
  - I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
- - We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
  - Don't catch cold.
  - Dr. Jones?
- - Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
  - You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
- - No -- don't you see -- crawling --
  - What -- the bug?
- - Get -- the -- bug -- off!
  - Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
- - Oh no -- oh no!!
  - You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
  - Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
- - What?!
  - Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
- - WILLIE?!
  - I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor!
    I can't see a thing!
- - There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
  - Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
- - GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look
    around!
  - A what?!
- - A fulcrum release lever!
  - I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
- - There's a hole! I found a square hole!
  - That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
  - I am -- it looks horrible!
- - Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
  - Willie!
- - What is it...?
  - It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
- - Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
  - No... the heart's still beating!
- - Let's go! Let's get out of here!
  - Quiet!
- - Wait -- what're you doing?
  - I'm going down.
  - Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
  - I'm not leaving without those stones.
  - You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
  - Maybe... someday.  Not today.
- - It's okay. You're all right now.
  - They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
- - What?
  - You've got to go to sleep now.
  - I want to go home...
  - I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
- - Indy? Did you talk to them?
  - Yes.
  - So now they believe me.
  - Yes, they believe you.
- - I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
  - No... they won't kill me.
  - You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have
    to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
- - What're we going to do?!
  - There's got to be another way out.
- - I can't!
  - Go!
- - Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
  - What above the curves?!
- - Anymore ideas...?
  - Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
- - I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
  - Not quite.
- - The last Sankara Stone.
  - And they don't even know what it really is.
  - Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
  - You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the
    fortune and glory you were talking about.
  - It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
- - On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
  - Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
  - You will go to palace there.
  - Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
  - No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
- - It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
  - I don't understand. What's happened here?
  - The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
  - What evil?
  - They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
- - It is why Krishna brought you here.
  - Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
  - No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you
    fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring
    back to us.
- - Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
  - Long ago -- before my father's father.
  - And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels
    of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
- - But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
  - They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
- - You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
  - I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
- - You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
  - Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
- - There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed
    by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
  - Two are still missing.
  - No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple
    and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the
    catacombs.
  - That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
  - They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two
    stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all
    powerful!
  - Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
  - You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
- - That's far enough!
  - You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
- - Give me the stones!
  - Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
- - No, the stones are mine!
  - You're betrayed Shiva.
- - Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
  - Step on it, Short Round!
  - Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
- - You got the tickets, Short Round?
  - Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
- - Indy?
  - Okay, Shorty.
- - Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
  - It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
- - I ride with you, Indy?
  - Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
- - Indy, look!
  - That's it. Pankot Palace.
- - What you look at, Indy?
  - Just a statue.
- - That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
  - You don't like him do you?
  - Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
  - No.
  - Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary
    voice!
- - He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
  - Yeah, that's what happened...
- - Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
  - Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with
    Willie.
- - What does it mean, Indy?
  - '"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."'
- - The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the
    lost Sankara Stones...
  - Why they glow like that?
  - Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them
    will glow.
- - This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
  - Why?
- - Come one, what's wrong?
  - Behind you!
- - Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
  - Read you loud and clear, Indy!
- - Let up on the brake!
  - What?
- - Dr. Jones.
  - Lao She.
  - Nee chin lie how ma?
- - You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
  - I don't like to show off.
- - So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
  - Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit
    my throat.
- - You have insulted my son.
  - Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
  - Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
- - What's that?
  - A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
- - Now what about the antidote, Lao.
  - At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
- - I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world
    the three of you would look at home...
  - Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and
    Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
  - Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
- - We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out
    way in the morning.
  - I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
- - I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's
    artifacts.
  - A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
  - Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently
    and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
- - I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
  - There are no stories anymore.
  - Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there
    told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient
    evil.
- - Their stories are just fear and folklore.
  - Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
- - You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
  - Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
  - Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
- - There, you see, Captain. A rock!
  - When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children
    were taken from them.
  - I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
- - I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock
    and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
  - Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in
    Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
  - The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
  - And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever
    returned to his country?
  - That was a misunderstanding.
  - Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
- - Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left
    the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
  - Yes, I understand.
- - You understand what he tells us?
  - Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping
    her with an offering of flesh and blood!
- - Hard to believe, isn't it...?
  - I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar
    Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
- - The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
  - You should have been there...
- - He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
  - No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
  - Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
- - They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes.
    Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
  - Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've
    to get ready!
- - Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
  - His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
  - No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
- - Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
  - I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a
    human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
- - I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit
    in Shanghai.
  - What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
- - I believe we're being called to dinner.
  - Finally!
- - Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want
    us to escort you to Delhi --
  - No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I
    think Indy's been --
  - What?
  - We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me,
    I'll show you!
- - Who?
  - It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching
    for.
- - Interested in local curios?
  - No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
- - Charming.
  - It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy --
    and gives you complete power over him.
  - Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
  - You think so?
  - Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost
    two hundred years now.
- - You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
  - This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have
    to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
- - The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
  - No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually
    runs this whole province.
- - I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
  - Something magical. A sacred rock.
- - Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
  - Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes
    you wonder what these people are...
- - I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let
    somebody like Willie go in there with me.
  - Miss Scott panicked?
  - When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room.
    She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
- - Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
  - Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
- - Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
  - Just a routine inspection tour.
  - The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for
    children.
- - Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a
    century.
  - Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices.
    The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
- - Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual
    here in Pankot.
  - I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
  - As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
- - Why are you trying to kill us?
  - Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
  - My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
  - No.
  - Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
  - If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
  - Then we'll die.
  - My soul is prepared. How's yours?
- - This is your last chance.
  - No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
- - All right! Where's my father
  - If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
  - Who are you?
  - My name is Kazim.
  - And why were you trying to kill me?
  - The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time
    the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep
    it safe.
- - Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
  - I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
  - In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the
    Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
- - Get that camel out of the way!
  - What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
  - Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister
    Brody with them.
- - That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
  - Come on -- come on!
- - I'm going after those horses.
  - I'll take the camels.
  - I don't need camels.
  - But, Indy --
  - No camels!
- - Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
  - Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
  - Where's my father?
  - They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
- - I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
  - Who are you?
  - The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
  - That was seven hundred years ago.
  - A long time to wait.
- - You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
  - I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
  - I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine
    until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished
    me.
- - Dad!
  - Out!
  - It's important!
  - Then wait -- count to twenty.
  - No, Dad. You listen to me --
  - Junior!
- - It is you Junior!
  - Don't call me that, please.
  - But what are you doing here?
  - I came to get you! What do you think?
- - Oh, it breaks the heart.
  - And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
  - I'll never forgive myself --
  - Don't worry -- I'm fine.
  - Thank God!
- - No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
  - Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
  - Dad, they come in through the doors.
  - Good point.
- - Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you
    my Diary. You obviously got it.
  - I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
  - Through the library?
  - Right.
  - I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
- - Found it.
  - He was actually there? You saw him?
  - Well, what was left of him.
  - And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
  - Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself
    for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
  - Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh,
    Junior...
- - '...you did it.'
  - No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
  - If only I could have been with you.
  - There were rats, Dad.
  - Rats?
  - Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
  - They want my diary.
  - Yeah?
- - You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
  - Well, uh...
  - You did!!
  - Look, can we discuss this later?
  - I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
  - Will you take it easy!
  - Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't
    fall into their hands!!
  - I came here to save you.
  - Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
- - No! Don't Shoot!
  - Don't worry. He won't.
- - She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
  - Umh?
  - How did you she was a Nazi?
  - She talks in her sleep.
- - Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
  - So did I.
  - Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis
    do!
  - You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
  - Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his
    own museum!
- - What am I looking for?
  - My lucky charm.
  - Feels like a cigarette lighter.
  - Try and burn through the ropes.
- - I ought to tell you something.
  - Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
  - The floor's on fire! See?!
  - What???
  - And the chair.
  - All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
- - Dad!
  - What?
  - Dad!
  - What?
  - Dad!
- - What?
  - Head for the fireplace!
  - Oh.
- - This is intolerable!
  - I'm out, Dad!
- - Dad!
  - '...the solution presents itself.'
- - Come on, Dad. Come on!
  - What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
- - Stop!
  - What?
  - Stop! Stop!
- - You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
  - Brody's this way.
  - My Diary's in Berlin.
  - You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
  - There is more in the Diary than just the map.
  - All right Dad -- tell me.
  - Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
  - What final challenge?
  - Three devices of such lethal cunning.
  - Booby traps?
  - Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles
    of St. Anselm.
  - But what are they? Can't you remember?
  - I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
  - Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's
    den?
  - Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
  - What about Marcus?
  - Marcus would agree with me.
  - Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
- - That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race
    against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march
    all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
  - This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
  - Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until
    all I could do was mourn her.
- - What did you get?
  - I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
  - Good.
- - When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
  - Relax.
- - You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
  - That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa...
    er, her grandfather!
  - Well, I'm as human as the next man.
  - I was the next man.
  - Ships that pass in the night...
- - Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
  - Hmmm... What did we talk about?
  - We didn't talk. We never talked.
  - And do I detect a rebuke?
  - A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For
    you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads,
    you'd have understood that.
  - Actually, I was a wonderful father.
  - When?
- - Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No.
    I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
  - What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been
    dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that
    we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
  - You left just when you were becoming interesting.
  - Dad, how can you?
  - Very well. I'm here now.
- - Well... I can't think of anything.
  - Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to
    Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the
    penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God
    will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head
    will he prove his worth."
  - What does that mean?
  - I don't know. We'll find out.
- - I didn't know you could fly a plane.
  - Fly... yes. Land... no.
- - Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
  - What happens at eleven o'clock?
- - Dad, are we hit?!
  - More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
- - Nice landing.
  - Thanks.
- - Those people are trying to kill us!
  - I know, Dad!
  - It's a new experience for me.
  - It happens to me all the time.
- - This is intolerable!
  - This could be close.
- - What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
  - Dad, we're well out of range.
- - Now, who are all these people?
  - Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah
    and I organize some transportation.
- - Dad?
  - You call this archaeology?
  - Get out of there, Dad!
- - Dad?!
  - Junior...
- - '"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."'
  - The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
  - The penitent man. The penitent...
- - The penitent man is humble before God.
  - Penitent. Penitent...
  - The penitent man is humble...
- - But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
  - '"J".'
- - Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
  - I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
- - Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
  - What did you find, Dad?
  - Me?... Illumination.
- - What did you find, Junior?
  - Junior?! Dad...
- - I like Indiana.
  - We named the dog Indiana.
- - Ready?
  - Ready.
- - Uh-huh.
  - After you, Junior.
  - Yes, sir!  Haaa!
- - Doctor Jones?
  - Yes?
  - I knew it was you --
- - And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
  - Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
- - The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking
    down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
  - Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
- - Fraulein -- will you permit me?
  - I usually don't.
  - I usually don't either.
  - In that case, I permit you.
- - It would make me very happy.
  - But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
  - Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
- - My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep
    it to ourselves.
  - Find something?
- - Bingo.
  - You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
  - Except he's lost, and I'm not.
  - Lower me down.
- - Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
  - Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
  - The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries
    later.
- - The Ark of the Covenant.
  - Are you sure?
  - Pretty sure.
- - It must be one of these...
  - Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
- - What's that?
  - It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
- - Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
  - He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death
    of them!
- - Don't wander off.
  - What?
- - I said go around!
  - You said go between them!
  - I said don't go between them!
- - My room!
  - Mine, too.
  - What were they looking for?
- - This.
  - The Grail Diary.
  - Uh-huh.
  - You had it? You didn't trust me!
- - At least I let you tag along.
  - Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
  - Knock it off. You're not mad.
  - No?
  - No. You like the way I do things.
  - It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice
    pier.
- - What do you know about this place?
  - I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
- - What are you going to do?
  - Don't know. Think of something.
- - This one. I think he's in here.
  - How do you know?
- - This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the
    unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
  - So it did.
- - How did you get here?
  - Where is it? I want it.
- - You came back for the book? Why?
  - My father didn't want it incinerated.
- - Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
  - Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for
    -- who gives a damn what you think?
  - You do.
- - All I have to do is squeeze.
  - All I have to do is scream.
- - I never expected to see you again.
  - I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
- - Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
  - It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
  - Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
- - Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
  - I can reach it. I can reach it...
- - My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
  - I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years
    have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very
    impressive.
  - Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look
    over here. This might interest you.
- - Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century,
    I should think.
  - That was our assessment as well.
  - Where did this come from?
  - My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating
    for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
- - '"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."'
  - The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper.
    The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of
    Arimathaea.
- - The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
  - Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh,
    now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
  - An old man's dream.
  - Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
- - Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
  - What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.
    Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd
    have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
  - Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
- - Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted
    to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before
    it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be
    exact.
  - I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one
    hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey
    back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old
    age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
  - Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
- - This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it
    doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised
    that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those
    "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's
    incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother.
    Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice,
    Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest
    that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
  - That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
  - You could be more right than you know.
  - Yes?
  - We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research.
    Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea
    of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where
    he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
  - You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
  - We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
- - DONOVAN!
  - Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
- - Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
  - As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
  - Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves
    into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want
    the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world,
    but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's
    gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
  - Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
  - You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
- - I'm through!
  - We're through!
- - Are you expected?
  - Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald
    that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
  - Tapestries?
  - Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
  - This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord,
    then I am Mickey Mouse.
  - How dare he?!
- - Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
  - Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
  - Schneider?
  - I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
  - Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
- - Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
  - I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
- - Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in
    the history of mankind.
  - You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
- - Marcus!
  - Arghhh! Oh!
- - Henry! What are you doing here?!
  - It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
- - Henry, the pen --
  - What?
  - But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
- - Look what you did!
  - It's war.
- - The Word of God...
  - No, Henry. Try not to talk.
  - The Name of God...
- - Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
  - Got lost in his own museum, huh?
- - Marcus!  I did it!
  - You've got it!
- - You know how long I've been looking for that?!
  - All your life.
  - All my life!
  - Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our
    Spanish collection.
- - Your treat.
  - Yes. My treat.
- - What has the old fool got himself into now?
  - I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
- - Dad?
  - It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
- - Venice, Italy!
  - What is it?
- - It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made.
    A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why
    would he have sent this to me?
  - I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
  - Do you believe, Marcus?
- - Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
  - The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
- - But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared
    to take a few things on faith.
  - Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
  - I'll tell him we'll take two.
- - Ah, Venice...
  - Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
  - I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
- - That doesn't look much like a library.
  - It looks like a converted church.
- - Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
  - Where?
- - Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
  - Dad was onto something here!
  - Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they
    mean.
- - How's the head?
  - It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
- - The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what
    the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon
    of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
  - Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
- - Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course
    turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains.
    Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name
    of the city.
  - Alexandretta. Now we know.
  - Yes. Now we know.
  - Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
- - What about you?
  - I'm going after Dad.
- - Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
  - It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
- - Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
  - Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
  - Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
  - You are on your own?
- - Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged
    our supplies?
  - Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
  - Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
- - Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
  - And I am his.
- - My reputation precedes me.
  - There is no museum in Iskenderun.
- - Yes.
  - Papers, sir. Got it here.
- - Yes.
  - Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
  - Did you say...? Uh, uh...
- - May we go home now, please?
  - The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
- - Why did you people come here?
  - Air... water... your "sun."
  - Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
  - Here... now.
  - And before here?
  - Many worlds...
  - Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace
    between us?
  - Peace? No peace.
  - What do you want us to do?
  - Die.
- - Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
  - Yes.
  - Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
- - See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment.
    But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The
    last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
  - People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to
    describe it!
- - What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
  - Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat,
    cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
- - Can they be killed?
  - These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just
    have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
- - I'm not leaving.
  - We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
  - I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint
    Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to
    a public hysteria that could cost lives.
  - But, Mr. President...
  - So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they
    won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home
    and take cover.
- - What the hell's going on?
  - We're leaving.
- - I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch
    a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've
    got.
  - Above American soil?
  - If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
- - Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
  - Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
- - Mr. President?
  - Deploy.
- - Call them back.
  - The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
  - I said call them back.
- - Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
  - I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say
    so myself.
  - It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
  - You sure?
  - Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who
    doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where
    are we supposed to go now?
- - They let you out?
  - Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
- - We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
  - You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
- - Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
  - For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money
    to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
- - I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space
    ship is heading this way.
  - We should leave too.
  - There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours
    away. I think we should follow them.
- - How' he doing?
  - Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
- - Stop it.
  - It's all fuzzy.
  - You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
- - I don't need it.
  - Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
- - He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
  - Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
  - That'd be cool!
- - But I gave you some this morning.
  - I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
- - I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to
    a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
  - How to kiss ass.
- - Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
  - I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
- - That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
  - Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
  - I hear you.
- - I shouldn't have left her.
  - Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
- - Damn it!
  - I didn't even see them fire!
  - Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
- - Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
  - We're already over Mach 2!
  - So push it!
- - Stevie... I can't...
  - Jimmy, stay with me.
- - Your son.
  - He's my angel.
  - Was his father stationed here?
  - He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
- - So, what do you do for a living?
  - I'm a dancer.
  - Really? Ballet?
  - No. Exotic.
  - Oh. Sorry.
  - Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
- - And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
  - Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't
    really matter anymore.
- - Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
  - I thought you didn't recognize me.
  - Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
- - He's trying to impress you.
  - He's doing a good job.
- - You can't go. Call them back.
  - Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
  - You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
  - They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
- - Wait. I have to tell you something.
  - What?
  - Be careful.
  - Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me
    on base.
  - Really? You don't mind?
  - Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
- - You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
  - Yes, I am.
  - Dick-weed!
  - Butt-munch.
- - You're late.
  - You know how I like to make a big entrance.
- - You're late.
  - You know me...
  - I know, you like to make a big entrance.
- - Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
  - Sorry for what?
  - I should have done this a long long time ago.
- - You scared the hell out of me.
  - Yeah, but what an entrance!
  - Dick-weed.
  - Butt-munch.
- - A meteor?
  - No Sir. Definitely not.
  - How do you know?
  - Well, er... it's slowing down.
  - It's doing what?
  - It's... slowing down, Sir.
- - Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
  - That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
- - Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
  - Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
- - More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
  - This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
  - We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere.
    Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
- - That's impossible...
  - My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
  - Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you
    waited to evacuate the cities!
- - You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this.
    When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
  - It had been deemed classified.
  - Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could
    have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American
    pilots!
- - This is ridiculous.
  - How long would their shields be down?
- - With their shields down it might be possible.
  - Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the
    manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that
    this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world
    is qualified to operate.
- - With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
  - I had a feeling you would.
  - Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
  - Then God help us.
- - General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five
    minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
  - But Mr. President...
  - And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
- - Is my wife in the air?
  - She should be shortly.
- - Any news on my wife?
  - The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
- - Where are they?
  - ETA with target; four minutes.
- - Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
  - And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
- - And our forces?
  - We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it
    takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction
    of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
  - We're being exterminated.
- - Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
  - Yes, Sir.
- - How're we doing?
  - Better than we thought.
- - We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world.
    Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
  - And our troops here?
  - We've been collecting planes from all over but...
  - But what, General?
  - Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
  - Then find them.
- - Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
  - I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
- - Grey, you read me?
  - Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
- - Where's it headed?
  - I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
- - Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
  - Roger.
- - I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
  - Oh shit, we're late.
  - We'll meet you there.
- - I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
  - Great.
- - What the hell are you doing?
  - Just getting a feel for her.
- - Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
  - Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
- - Get us out of here!
  - I can't shake her free.
- - What're you doing?
  - It's not me. They're overriding the system.
- - Nice meeting you.
  - You as well.
- - We're loose!
  - Doesn't matter. Game's over.
  - I don't hear no fat lady.
- - What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting
    there.
  - I'm thinking.
  - So think already.
- - You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
  - You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
- - David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much
    time with me, but...
  - Dad, don't start.
  - I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce
    papers.
  - Three years.
  - Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
- - Pops!
  - The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
  - You still got the Olds?
  - You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
  - That's okay. You're driving.
- - It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the
    bell.
  - Can't this thing go any faster?
  - You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for
    the President. They know everything.
  - They don't know this.
  - And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come
    you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
  - Dad...
  - All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want
    HBO, they'll call you.
- - What the hell is that?
  - This, pops, is every phone book in America.
  - You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
  - She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just
    her first initial, sometime her nickname...
- - Not listed, huh?
  - I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
  - Spunky?
  - College nickname.
  - You try Martin?
  - She didn't take my name when we were married.
- - Perfect, she's using it.
  - It's perfect the line is busy?
  - Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
  - You can do that?
- - Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
  - Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
  - You punched the President in the face?
  - He wasn't the President then.
- - It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
  - Moishe, please, don't talk.
- - Dad, please...
  - What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up
    in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew
    and you didn't do nothing!
- - David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
  - I'm making a mess.
  - This I can see.
  - We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip
    up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
  - David, you're drunk.
- - Pops, you're a genius!
  - What'd I say?
  - A cold? Of course.
- - Thanks, Pops.
  - I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
- - What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
  - It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
  - Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow,
    static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
- - What the hell is this?
  - So sue me.
- - Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
  - Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
- - Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
  - We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
- - There's good news and bad news.
  - What's the bad news?
  - You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
  - And the good news is you won't charge me.
  - No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some
    weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
  - That's the good news?
- - Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded
    within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed
    signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should
    be able to block out the overlay completely...
  - '...and we''ll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That''s my man.'
- - I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
  - Huh? Oh, good, good.
  - Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately
    seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually
    it will disappear. Are you listening?
  - Can you believe this?
  - What're you talking about?
  - Haven't you been watching?
- - Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
  - What happened?
  - Just do it!
- - Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
  - Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly
    recycling down to extinction.
  - Not really...
  - That signal. It's a countdown.
  - A countdown to what?
  - Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then,
    when the timing's right. You strike.
- - Then what?
  - Checkmate.
- - Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
  - More than likely.
- - I don't know how you put up with him.
  - He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
  - I'll bet.
- - You saved a lot of lives.
  - I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf
    War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore,
    Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
- - We're losing them.
  - Then get them out of there.
- - David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
  - Punched the President? Oh my god.
- - Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
  - My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
- - He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you
    two.
  - Think nothing of it, Spanky.
- - Spunky. He told you about that?
  - All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
  - Love was never our problem.
  - All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
- - What do you want?
  - You have to leave the White House.
  - This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
  - You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
- - In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
  - I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal.
    They're going to attack...
  - You're being paranoid.
  - It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
- - What?
  - Connie, don't hang up.
  - David? How'd you get this number?
  - Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
- - And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
  - Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
- - What do you want me to do?
  - I want you to leave with us. Right now.
  - I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
  - He's not going to listen to me.
- - You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
  - David, don't...
- - Just my luck, no ice.
  - I take it you've heard.
  - A toast to the end of the world.
- - You still believe in him.
  - He's a good man.
  - Better be. You left me for him.
  - I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
- - Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
  - We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
- - With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the
    virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
  - If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
- - Are you all right?
  - Did it work?
  - You bet it did.
- - Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
  - It's really nice of you to help us.
  - I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
  - We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
  - Cool.
- - This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
  - If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
- - What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
  - Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
  - His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating
    a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
  - Oh?
  - What's his family background?
  - They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I
    really don't know much about them.
- - Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
  - Why, yes.
  - Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
  - All right.  I'll be right back.
- - Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
  - Mom -- this is the best show all year.
  - I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
- - What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
  - No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
- - George, where have you been?
  - What happened to your other slipper?
- - Your father asked you a question.
  - What? -- I...
- - Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
  - The back door was open.
- - Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
  - What?
  - Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
- - When?
  - This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
  - I have school.
  - I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
- - It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares
    myself.
  - What kind, Mom?
  - Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
- - This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
  - No.
  - Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
  - I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
  - Can you tell me about that?
- - That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
  - Yes.
  - A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then
    it gets the police, and your teacher too.
- - How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
  - She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind
    the hill.
  - What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
  - I'd believe him.
  - Why?
  - '''Cause he wouldn''t lie.'
- - Do you know how to follow a map?
  - Yes.  I can even read star maps.
  - This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so
    there's less chance of you being seen.
- - Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
  - I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down
    there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
  - Where, Jimmy?
  - Behind my house, up on the ridge.
  - If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this
    is all in your mind.
- - This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
  - I don't see anything.
  - No, but it was here.
- - I swear it was here.
  - But it's not, Jimmy.
  - No.
  - Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
- - They'll get us.
  - We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there
    would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
- - Does it look to you like anything landed here?
  - Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
- - Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
  - Who are you calling?
  - The State Police.
- - Did you call the State Police?
  - All their lines were busy.
- - No one comes here after dark.
  - Hide the car.
- - Damn.
  - I know a way.
- - What is it?
  - I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
- - But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
  - Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
- - Don't go in.
  - I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
  - We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
  - There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking
    in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could
    do something.
  - Let's try.
- - You're looking for life?
  - They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
- - Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
  - I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
  - Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
  - May I ask why?
  - We were having a little talk.
  - About what?
  - Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
  - I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like
    to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
  - Mr. Gardner, I --
  - You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children
    to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your
    idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
  - Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
  - I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct.
    My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy
    with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
  - Of course.
- - We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
  - Yes, Mr. Gardner.
- - What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
  - I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back
    -- he was gone.
- - What did he talk to you about?
  - He was upset with moving, I believe.
  - Is that all he said?
  - Why, yes.  Why?
- - I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house
    needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and
    eat or you'll be late.
  - I'll take you to school.
  - You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got
    to run.
- - It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it
    if we found anything wrong.
  - I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
- - What happened to you?  Who was that?
  - That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
  - Where's your car?
  - I left it at work.
  - You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
- - I'm home now.
  - Yes -- but ...
- - You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk
    after dinner.
  - George, you're acting very strangely.
- - What's wrong, Ellen?
  - It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of
    the hill.
- - Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
  - Good night.
- - Son ... are you awake?
  - Yes.
- - We're going to be moving, son.
  - Do we have to?
  - I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's
    a pretty part of the country.
  - I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
  - You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
- - What's that, Dad?
  - That's the Air Force Base.
- - Wow.  Look at the mountains.
  - This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
  - Is the hill ours too?
  - If we want it, it is.
  - Let's check it out, Dad.
- - Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
  - It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
  - Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
- - A meteorite, Dad, look!
  - It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
  - Why, Dad?
  - Because the sky is so clear out here.
- - There are more this year than last.
  - This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
  - There's Cassius ...
- - '... and Rigel.'
  - And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
- - Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
  - That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a
    point in the sky.
- - Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
  - Okay.
- - Jim -- what's wrong?!
  - You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
- - It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
  - What did it look like?
  - It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was
    flat, then it was long and thin.
- - Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed
    shape --
  - I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
  - I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
- - Are you all right, Dad?
  - Sure ... fine.
- - I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
  - Was there anything over the hill?
- - I had an awful dream.
  - What, Jim, what?
  - First lemme look at your necks.
- - '... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.'
  - That's a doozy of a dream, son.
  - It was so real, Dad.
  - It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand
    pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and
    the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know
    them ...
- - I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
  - I was so scared.
  - Better now, son?
- - Need some gas?
  - Please.
  - Only got one kind.
  - That's fine.
- - Hell of a night.
  - You got that right.
- - So, what do you do?
  - I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
  - You built things.
  - I guess you could say that.
- - Bathroom?
  - Round back.
- - I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
  - Yes.
  - It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was
    loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you
    come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here
    comes Mr. Smooth thing.
- - You and that damned garden.
  - Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
  - I surrender --
  - Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
  - It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
  - Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
- - The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
  - Virginia...?
  - What?
- - Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
  - Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
  - That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
  - Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
  - Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
  - They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
  - That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
  - Stay alive.
- - You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
  - No.
- - I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners
    --
  - You lived like this once.
  - That is not now, human!
  - My name is Robert.
- - It is not arguing to speak the truth.
  - Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could
    find some way to --
- - Are you all right?
  - Yes.
  - Do you want to go on?
- - How much do you remember?
  - It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
- - Do you remember where you lived?
  - It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
  - What about... now?
  - With them?
  - Yes.
  - We move.  Place to place.
- - When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
  - Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
- - Who is this?
  - My wife.
- - Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
  - Yes.
- - Do you remember where it is?
  - What?
  - Where you lived with them.
- - You want to find them.
  - Yes.
  - You want to kill them.
- - Why don't you start with me?
  - You're not them.
- - What choice did I have -- ?!
  - You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
  - I only protect myself -- !
  - You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
  - If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
- - What do you want?
  - What do you mean?
  - You know what I mean.
- - Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until
    I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
  - We don't know that --
  - I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
- - Mine.
  - Have you always had it?
  - I don't know.
  - Have you looked inside?
  - Yes.
  - What's inside?
  - Humans.
  - Who?
  - I don't know.
- - That's who you are too, Emma.
  - Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now
    I... remember.
- - You want me to stay?
  - Yes.
- - Do you still want me to stay?
  - Yes.
- - Emma...
  - He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
  - Shhh... don't talk.
  - I want to talk.  I just learned again.
- - You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
  - I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
- - Now and then. You know how it is.
  - You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota
    Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
  - Is that a fact?
  - Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off
    them balls.
  - Where do you come from?
  - California. Oakland.
  - California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
  - That's right.
  - I hear you've been looking for me.
  - Yeah. That's right, too.
  - Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
- - Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
  - Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
  - Hundred dollars?
  - Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot
    big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
  - Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage!
    Rack 'em up!
- - Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
  - Twelve. Cross side.
- - And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like
    he's playing a violin or something.
  - Nine ball.  Three ball.
- - Your shot.
  - You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
  - That's what the game's all about.
  - Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
- - Very good shot.
  - You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One
    ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you
    feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about
    this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table,
    man. I own it.
- - Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
  - Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
  - Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
- - Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
  - Game's over, Eddie.
  - Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
  - You watch me.
- - I came to play pool, Fats.
  - That's good, Eddie. For how much?
  - You name it.
  - Thousand dollars a game.
  - Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars.
    That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta
    do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
  - Let's go.
- - Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
  - I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
- - I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself
    a pool player.
  - Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
- - '...you shoot a great game of pool.'
  - So do you, Fast Eddie.
- - Long wait for a bus?
  - Yes.
- - How long you been waiting?
  - What?
  - How long have you been waiting?
  - Since four.
- - Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you,
    uh, like another cup?
  - Fine, thanks.
- - What time does the bus leave?
  - What bus?
  - Yours.
  - Eight o'clock.
- - That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
  - Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
- - Have a nice trip.
  - Thanks. I will.
- - Have a nice trip?
  - Fair.
  - Can I sit down?
  - Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
  - Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
  - Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
  - Can I buy you another drink?
- - It's the lights. And the scotch.
  - How come you didn't catch your bus?
  - I wasn't waiting for a bus.
  - Then why go to the bus station?
  - 'Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven''t much choice. Besides,
    I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?'
  - Around.
  - 'I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What''s it like living
    in a locker?'
  - Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
  - Do you always ask so many questions?
  - No, not always.
  - Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open
    until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't
    you trust me, Mack?
- - You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
  - I used to be an actress.
  - Yeah? What do you do now?
  - I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
  - You don't look like a college girl.
  - I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
  - No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young
    enough.
  - I'm not.
  - So why go to college?
  - I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
  - What do you do on the other days?
  - I drink.
  - Hey!
  - No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
  - Eddie. The name is Eddie.
  - The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
  - I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
  - I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know
    its meaning?
  - I could always get us a bottle.
  - No.
  - Fifth of scotch?
  - What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
  - No. I'll take you home.
- - Why did you do that?
  - I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
  - A day like any other. People come, people go.
  - Give me a drag.
- - What time is it?
  - Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
  - Why?
  - Come here.
- - Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving
    cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
  - What did you say that for, Sarah?
  - How did you know my name was Sarah?
  - You told me.
  - I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
  - Okay. So what's your name today?
  - Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles.
    Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
- - I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
  - I'm not sure... I don't know.
  - Well, what do you want to know? And why?
- - Where you been all day?
  - At school. It's Thursday.
  - Oh, I forgot.
- - You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
  - Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
- - You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems
    as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say,
    "Listen, I got a fella."
  - Thanks.
  - Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
  - Museums... art galleries... concerts.
- - Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
  - You want to go with me?
  - What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book
    ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read
    all them books?
  - Mm hmm.
  - You got it all in your head?
  - When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're
    mixed up.
  - Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like
    it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
  - I'm getting treatments right here.
- - I'm hungry.
  - Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till
    Tuesday.
  - What did all this stuff cost you?
  - When you've got money, you'll pay.
  - No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
  - The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
  - Don't you ever cook anything?
  - Eggs. How do you like them?
  - Raw.
- - Oh, cut my finger.
  - I've got something in my bag.
  - Oh, it's not bad.
- - Eddie, what's in that case?
  - Haven't you opened it?
  - No, why should I? It's yours.
  - It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have
    a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this?
    I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
  - From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
- - Do you want me to go?
  - No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
- - You going out?
  - Yeah. For a little while.
- - What are you writing?
  - Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
- - Give it to me.
  - What's this supposed to mean?
  - Give it back to me.
  - 'What''s this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have
    to do is pull the blinds down."'
- - You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens,
    Eddie?
  - You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
  - That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
- - Who is it?
  - Me. It's Eddie.
- - What happened?
  - I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
- - You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
  - You wanna drink?
  - No. You?
  - What's it so hot in here for?
- - Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
  - A loser?
  - Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
  - Would he know?
  - He knows. A lot.
  - Why did he tell you?
  - I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are
    always looking for an excuse to lose.
  - What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
  - He's a gambler.
  - Is he a winner?
  - Well, he owns things.
  - Is that what makes a winner?
  - Well, what else does?
  - Does it bother you? What he said?
  - Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames
    with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom...
    Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat
    him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show
    those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's
    really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great...
    I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's
    doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when
    I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on
    his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin'
    into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when
    to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing,
    touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right,
    and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool
    cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece
    of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't
    have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And
    you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
  - You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way
    about anything. I love you, Eddie.
- - You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college
    professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie
    Felson, hustler.
  - I love you.
  - You need the words?
  - Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them
    back.
- - You glad?
  - Yes, I'm glad.
- - Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
  - Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
  - I feel pretty.
- - Well, what's so funny?
  - Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
  - First time for everything.
- - What is it, Eddie?
  - Nothin'.  Want another drink?
  - What do you want to tell me?
  - Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
  - For how long?
  - Oh, I don't know.
  - A week? A year?
  - More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
  - Sure. Let's go home.
- - No, I want to walk.
  - Come here. Come on, now.
- - Don't you want to know where I'm going?
  - No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
  - I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I
    need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
  - Leave now.
  - Oh, grow up.
  - Why should I?
  - Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley.
    Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
  - If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't
    have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling
    me.
  - Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
  - What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull
    the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And
    you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
  - I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know
    what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
  - I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me?
    I love you.
  - Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
  - No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything
    else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never
    an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven.
    He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The
    men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up.
    But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
- - Fifty-seven.
  - I'll be up later.
- - Where's Bert?
  - He went off someplace.
  - Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I
    won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and
    forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
  - Why?
  - Just for luck.
- - If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
  - Well, what's the matter?
  - I'm a little tired.
- - Go on back to the hotel.
  - Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
  - Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
  - Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything
    to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath
    the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
  - Shut up.
- - Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who
    broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your
    heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what
    you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
  - Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you
    GET OFF MY BACK?!
- - Hi.
  - Hi.
- - How much you playin' for?
  - A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
  - Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
  - Okay, friend.
- - You quittin' too?
  - You're a pretty good player.
  - How much are you ahead?
  - Couple of bucks.
  - I guess it's just you and me, huh?
  - Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
  - You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
  - You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
  - Try me.
  - Shoot.
  - Okay.
- - You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
  - Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten
    bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
  - Okay, friend. You're on.
  - Call it.
  - Heads.
- - You better not miss, friend.
  - I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
- - You quittin', friend?
  - Yeah, I'm quittin'.
- - Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
  - Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
  - Who's he?
  - Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
  - Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in
    my pocket.
  - Oh man, you're way out of our league.
- - What's the limit?
  - Half and a dollar.
  - Gimme ten bucks.
  - Ten dollars.
- - No, no more for me.
  - Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
- - Findley.
  - Glad to meet you.
  - And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards,
    don't you?
  - Now and then. Why, do you?
  - A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
- - I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
  - How much?
  - Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
- - When?
  - You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
  - That's right. When?
  - Would you like to come out tonight?
  - What time?
  - I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all
    come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
- - You gentlemen care for a drink?
  - No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
  - By all means.
- - I thought we came here to play pool.
  - I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't
    have to play if you don't want to.
- - Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson.
    Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
  - Oh no, nothing for me.
- - Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
  - Okay?
- - There it is. I'm broke.
  - Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
  - For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get
    off me now.
- - Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
  - Yeah, sure has.
  - Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the
    door, but I...
  - Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
  - Yeah. You must come again.
  - Yeah. Sure.
- - Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand
    bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
  - Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him,
    one for yourself.
- - It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
  - Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
- - You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
  - Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
  - You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
  - I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
  - Why?
  - Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that
    shot just the way I made it before.
  - Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
- - Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
  - You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
  - Whaddya mean?
  - Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
  - Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got
    my money on the table.
  - I don't want it.
- - Well... well, now.
  - Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
  - Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip,
    and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay...
    Go ahead. Set 'em up.
- - It's quiet.
  - Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
  - Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs
    on.
  - I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
- - Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me?
    C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
  - Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
  - Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can
    walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling
    an old man for a dime a game.
- - How do you feel?
  - Fast and loose, man.
  - In the gut, I mean.
  - I feel tight -- but good.
- - Quit. He's too good.
  - Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
- - Hey, how much are we ahead?
  - Approximately? One thousand bucks.
  - Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
- - How much we got?
  - Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
  - Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup
    of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
  - Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel.
    Pool game is over.
  - No, it isn't, Charlie.
  - Eddie...
  - The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
  - You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
  - Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
  - Get with what?
  - You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it.
    I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool
    game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
- - Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
  - Give me a drink, will ya?
  - You don't need a drink.
  - Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
- - What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill
    yourself?
  - What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
  - Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
  - Go on home. Just leave me the money.
  - Go to hell.
  - Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
  - Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
- - Is this all we got left?
  - If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
- - Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
  - Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
  - Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
  - I asked around.
- - Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
  - Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
  - How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
  - So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
- - You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark.
    We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
  - A son.
  - Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time
    I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
  - Talk to me, Charlie.
  - I want you to come back on the road with me.
  - Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
  - What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking
    up eight, ten bucks a day?
  - I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
  - Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's
    on your mind?
  - Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and
    those diamond rings, and that carnation.
  - This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and
    he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
  - I told you you'd get your money back.
  - 'He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie?
    We''re together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme
    the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care
    about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class
    con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we
    were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had
    money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I''ll tell you what -- take her
    along.'
- - With what?
  - Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
  - Oh yeah? Where?
  - What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another
    drink?
- - HOW MUCH?!
  - My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
  - Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed,
    Charlie.
  - Aw, Eddie.
  - C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
  - What for? To play Fats again?
  - Yeah, to play Fats again.
  - You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna
    give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
  - You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie.
    You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more
    years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might
    make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and
    a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
  - Is that what you think?
  - Yeah, that's what I think.
  - All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting
    old.
  - Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
- - Just like that?
  - Yeah. Just like that.
- - Maybe. You want to play?
  - No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
  - Who's he?
  - What's your game? What do you shoot?
  - You name it, we shoot it.
  - Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk
    into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
  - Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters
    in this here poolroom?
  - What kind of straight pool game you like?
  - The expensive kind.
  - Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
  - Yeah, that's right.
  - Want some free advice?
- - He's my partner.
  - You well-heeled, partner?
- - You got that wrong, mister. I am.
  - Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play
    him, friend.
  - Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
  - Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay
    where you are. He'll find you.
- - Hey, mister.
  - The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
  - Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers
    me.
- - Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
  - What did he say?
- - Okay?
  - Sit down.
- - Make it twenty.
  - Cut.
  - Deal.
- - Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
  - Two.
- - I'm buyin'.
  - Thought you only drank milk.
  - Only when I work.
  - Yeah? Why?
  - I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and
    it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse
    for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
  - I lost twenty bucks.
  - Poker's not your game.
  - What is?
  - Pool.
  - You being cute?
  - I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot
    the other night at Ames. You got talent.
  - So I got talent. So what beat me?
  - Character.
  - Yeah. Sure, sure.
  - You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think
    you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing
    but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause
    he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you
    got in your whole skinny body.
  - I got drunk.
  - He drank as much whisky as you did.
  - Maybe he knows how to drink.
  - You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink
    whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
  - Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles?
    What do I do, go home?
  - That's your problem.
  - So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time
    I'll develop myself some character.
- - Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
  - A thousand.
  - No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll
    beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man
    who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe
    more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just
    might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't
    count on it.
  - How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
  - See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine.
    I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business
    to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off
    of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
  - In that case, you owe me another drink.
- - Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
  - Whaddya been so far?
  - Eddie, you're a born loser.
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  - First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you
    let him off.
  - I told you. I got drunk.
  - 'Sure, you got drunk. That''s the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble
    losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back
    too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta
    do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It''s one of the best indoor sports: feeling
    sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.'
  - Thanks for the drink.
  - Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
  - To do what?
  - Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
  - Why?
  - Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
  - Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
  - Seventy-five per cent.
  - For who?
  - For me.
  - That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
  - How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin'
    up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you
    win.
  - You think I can lose?
  - I never saw you do anything else.
  - You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
  - Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody
    pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the
    game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only
    way.
  - Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game
    and get rich. You know all the angles.
  - I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for
    is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
  - Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe
    we can talk.
  - No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
  - Kiss off.
- - Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
  - There are places. I'll scuffle around.
  - Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat
    you alive.
  - Now, when did you adopt me?
  - I don't know when it was.
- - Hello, Eddie.
  - Hi. How's business?
  - Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
  - Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
  - Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
  - I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
  - What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
  - Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
  - Man named Turk Baker?
  - You know everybody, don't you?
  - Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
  - Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
  - Sign up.
  - Where do I sign?
  - The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
  - You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
  - What happened to you anyway?
  - Like I told ya. My thumbs.
  - No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
  - I been thinking.
  - Thinking about what?
  - Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five
    per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
  - Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
- - Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
  - Miss Packard. How do you do?
- - James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco
    company.
  - What? And he -- he hustles pool?
  - He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers.
    He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old
    bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
  - How good is he?
  - I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
- - You must have a lot of confidence in me.
  - I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  - Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be
    about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
- - Here, I got it.
  - No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
- - Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya.
    He played it smart.
  - I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
  - Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face,
    cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all
    ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all
    set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were
    doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around
    in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
- - Fine.
  - Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
  - Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
- - You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and
    the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
  - Come on, let's go...
- - Hey, Findley's here.
  - Where?
  - Over there by the bar.
- - Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
  - Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
- - So does Eddie.
  - Well, I win sometimes.
- - What's the matter? What happened?
  - It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go
    upstairs and sleep it off.
- - Well, we won't.
  - C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
  - How much?
- - Sure.
  - You hustlin' me?
- - How do we stand?
  - '''Bout even.'
  - When do I raise the bet?
  - I don't know.
  - Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
  - Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
  - What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do
    is get the feel of it.
- - I can beat him.
  - All right. Five hundred.
- - I'll beat him the next game.
  - How're the hands?
  - They're fine.
  - Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
- - Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
  - I said we're leavin'.
- - I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't
    think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
  - I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
  - All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
- - Please don't get off me now.
  - I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
  - What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you
    got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
- - I wanna walk.
  - It's a long walk.
  - I got time, Bert.
  - You want me to tell her for you?
  - Tell her what?
  - You gotta be hard, Eddie.
- - Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
  - And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
  - Half.
  - In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
  - Well, here it's half.
  - What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
  - You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if
    I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
- - So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
  - I'm a businessman, kid.
  - Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
  - Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
  - Fifty per cent?
  - No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
  - We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
  - Aaaahhhh!
  - Boy, we really gave it to her good.
  - If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't
    happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
  - And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat
    cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in
    mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean
    anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said,
    win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're
    a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything
    else dead around ya.
- - Could be.
  - Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could
    play a few games of billiards.
- - We'll be there.
  - Good, good.
- - Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
  - You ever played billiards before?
- - I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred
    dollars to find out.
  - Deal the cards.
- - How much?
  - Oh, about five hundred.
  - Do you really think you can beat him?
  - Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't.
    Right, Felson?
  - I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him
    will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
- - Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you.
    It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
  - It's possible.
- - That seems a shame. The night is young.
  - The night is two thousand dollars old.
- - Will you take a check, Bert?
  - Cash.
  - How much do I owe you?
  - Twelve thousand.
- - You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
  - Packard. Sarah Packard.
  - It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure
    you don't want anything?
  - No, I'm fine.
  - You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
  - I've never been to Louisville.
  - Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed
    and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
- - I'm ready.
  - Soon as I finish my coffee.
- - What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
  - I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
- - Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
  - Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
- - It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of
    speech.
  - That's right, Miss Packard.
  - And a fact is a fact.
  - She's a smart girl, Eddie.
- - Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
  - We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
- - I want to talk to you.
  - Do we need words?
  - Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad
    for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
  - You know what's good for him?
  - To win.
  - For whom and for what?
  - For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
  - You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
  - All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
  - No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy
    them today, and you buy cheap.
  - Well, nobody has to sell.
- - You bastard.
  - Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging
    on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and
    you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't
    make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
- - I'll make it up to you.
  - How?
  - You tell me.
- - Are you ready for another?
  - Thank you.
- - In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
  - It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
- - Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
  - That's the way it's done.
  - And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just
    beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
  - All I want's the money.
  - Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart.
    You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
- - Boys just passing through?
  - Yep.
  - Pittsburgh?
  - Mm hmm.
  - Comin' in or goin' out?
  - Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
  - What do you guys sell?
- - Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have
    plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
  - Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the
    heat?
- - About sixty, seventy bucks.
  - Next game, ten bucks.
- - Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
  - You want a chaser?
  - No.
- - Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
  - Check!
  - You look different... More relaxed.
- - Give me a bottle of beer.
  - Right.
- - Huh?
  - It's open...  What'll you have?
- - Wait!
  - Yes?
  - I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you
    were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
- - Mother?
  - Yes... Derek.
- - It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have
    to go back into the woods now... forever.
  - Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's
    good to see you again though.
  - Yes.
  - I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
  - I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
- - So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
  - Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
  - No, why?
  - Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on
    edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
  - Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what
    you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
  - I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
  - I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no
    small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in
    this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare
    is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little
    physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not
    perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to
    leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
  - And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
- - Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
  - Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
- - Oh boy!
  - Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to
    shock you, but just in case.
  - Okay. That's fair.
- - This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
  - I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention
    a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon
    sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street
    vendors.
- - I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand
    the problem.
  - Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently
    in the world.
  - I bow to your expertise in these matters.
  - Lila?
- - Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
  - Yahoo!
  - Tomorrow, the acid test.
- - Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
  - And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
  - Extra dessert?
  - Even better.
- - Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table
    drawer.
  - It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
  - I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper
    thing.
  - Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility
    in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
  - 'Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don''t ever do what you really want to do.'
  - Got it.
- - Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
  - It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological
    community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of
    Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a
    vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then
    to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph
    Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
- - Thanks to you, Nate.
  - Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
- - And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
  - here, here.
- - Interesting.
  - Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
- - Ugnh.
  - Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching
    you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything
    very original or challenging to say on the subject.
  - Unn.
  - Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want
    you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
- - Puff, put the gun down.
  - Ounpoo. Ungh.
  - Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't
    we?
  - Unka unka unka unka unka.
  - Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go
    on my way. You'll never see me again.
  - I have to talk. Is that okay?
- - You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete
    being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical,
    angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became
    you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to
    do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature
    of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I
    will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract
    thinking from you.
  - No.
- - Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
  - Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
  - As do I.
  - They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get
    distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care
    that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
  - They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
  - You've got to respect that.
  - I have to say that I'm not there yet.
  - Where?
  - Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have
    many human characteristics.
  - That's not necessarily a bad thing.
  - Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
  - I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so
    sure anymore that we should want to.
  - I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy
    lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've
    been seeing someone. A therapist.
  - You are a therapist, right?
  - No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals.
    Mice at the moment.
  - I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
  - Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners,
    to be candid.
  - How's it going?
  - Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive.
    Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
  - Paper or cloth?
  - I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological
    experiment. I'm federally funded.
  - What's the larger experiment?
  - It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught
    to humans.
  - Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
  - The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations
    of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely
    follows closely at its heels.
  - I'm not sure.
  - Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse.
    Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
  - We are animals after all.
  - Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can
    teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.
- - It looks wonderful.
  - You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly
    and my personal life is ...
- - Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
  - My God! The fork! The fork!
  - I'm sorry?
  - Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside
    fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
  - Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
  - No biggie.
- - Boy, this is good!
  - I'm sorry that I became so upset.
  - No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
  - It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
  - You do?
  - Yes, and...
  - You really enjoy my company?
  - Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty
    and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
- - It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
  - I like you, too, Nathan.
  - You do?
  - Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
  - I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
- - Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
  - Nathan!
- - What are you doing in there?
  - I'll be out in a minute.
  - I'm sorry about my parents.
  - You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless,
    cruel animal jokes.
  - I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly
    to you about nature.
  - Do you?
  - Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
- - Do you? Oh do you, darling?
  - Why certainly!
- - Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
  - That's a great idea.
- - It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
  - Terrific. Can't wait!
- - Shaving cream?
  - I don't think so.  Why?
- - Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
  - Yes, darling.
  - Oh, and the sun block?
  - Of course.
  - What SPF, sweetie?
  - Fifteen.
  - Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect
    repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would
    save.
  - Yes, darling.
  - I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first
    aid kit?
  - Yes.
  - Flares?
  - Absolutely.
  - We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
  - That's very funny.
  - I love you so much.
- - Did you see that?
  - What?
  - I don't know. Something.
  - A deer?
  - No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
  - It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
- - Come on.
  - If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything.
    It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen.
    They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
- - You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
  - I think he's feral.
  - Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
  - He looks perfectly fine.
  - I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or
    whatever feral things do.
  - I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean,
    here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free,
    and all you want to do is run back to your...
  - Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
  - What?
  - Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
  - Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
  - It's perfect!
  - Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
  - 'Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I''m
    on to stage five: The human subject.'
  - Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
  - Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top
    of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
  - I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
  - Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness?
    Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of
    little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after
    a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of
    reality.
  - You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
  - Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
- - '...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human?
    Think of this poor soul''s education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...'
  - All right.
  - Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
- - What are you doing in there?
  - Nothing. Be right out.
- - Who is it?
  - Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
- - Who is it?
  - Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh.
    Exactly.
- - Who from work?
  - Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
- - It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
  - Your entire body?
  - I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have
    to...
  - You have to shave? Like an ape?
  - Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
  - Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
  - I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
  - Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
  - I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
  - I have to think! I have to think!
- - Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
  - You are an animal.
  - Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
  - I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
  - I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
- - So, how's it going today?
  - Good. Making progress.
  - Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained
    for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
- - Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
  - Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
- - Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
  - Of course not.
  - It would just be helpful to know.
  - No.
  - Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we
    hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
  - I'm just preoccupied.
  - Do you like my new look?
  - Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
  - I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want,
    Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
  - Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly
    what I want.
  - Really?
  - Sure. Of course.
  - Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of
    the elctrolysis.
  - That's great.
  - I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
- - That's great. It's a great color for you.
  - Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
- - Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
  - '...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.'
  - You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
  - Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
  - I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch
    on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what
    you drink.  Voila!
- - How's work?
  - Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
  - No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
  - My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
  - Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
  - I guess.
- - Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this
    project, but I've come around.
  - Have you?
  - Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this
    poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What
    a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
  - Really?
  - Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving
    up that crazy nature writing anyway.
  - How come?
  - Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly
    things! I love being a woman because...
  - Such as what womanly things?
  - Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my
    man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting
    for the Ladies Home Journal!
  - I had sold my fucking soul.
  - I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time
    though I thought it might help.
- - Bravo to you, Puff!
  - That was wonderful!
- - I think he's ready.
  - Oh boy!
- - You just have to control it. We're not apes.
  - Thank you very much for that.
- - Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
  - Absolutely!
- - I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
  - Should I come with?
  - Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
  - Ummm. It's good.
- - You were gone a long time.
  - Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well
    read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make
    us famous, Lila.
  - So he's doing okay?
  - Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
  - That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse
    on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after
    spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh,
    and what did you do tonight, honey?
  - Shit.
  - And what did you do tonight, honey?
  - I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
  - And what did you do tonight, honey?
  - I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
  - Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
  - Yes.
  - I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
  - Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
  - How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
  - Lila...
- - Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know
    more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in
    your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know
    the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
  - Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
  - Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
- - Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
  - Ugnh.
- - Look at you two. You both disgust me.
  - Oook. Oook.
  - Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from
    this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners.
    And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get?
    I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you
    ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally
    selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize
    that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived
    in a silk suit.
  - Ooka.
  - Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon,
    monkey boy.
- - Progress!
  - Ouch. Yeah?
  - Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's
    butt.
  - I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
  - You still in the market for a real boy?
  - Always. Ow.
  - Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
  - Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
  - I don't get that. Is that sexual?
  - Shut up and tell me.
  - Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
  - Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
  - Loves animals. Loves you.
  - What do you mean?
  - Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving
    psychologist said he would love to meet you.
  - Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship,
    did he?
  - My brother is discreet.
  - Won't he be able to tell?
  - My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know
    how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which
    is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which
    he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non-
    judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
  - God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
  - Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
- - So?
  - I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
  - My brother says he likes you, too.
  - Really?
  - Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according
    to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
- - My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
  - I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
  - Yeah?
  - He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis
    or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can
    feel completely safe with.
  - Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap
    thrill.
  - One night stand?
  - No. I married a midget.
  - Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
  - Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what
    made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap
    about it, my dear.
  - I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
  - Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship.
    They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the
    right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
  - I have a friend you might like to meet.
  - Oh?
  - Three foot one.
  - Be still my crotch.
  - Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
  - Yeah. My brother told me.
  - And I think I'm going to.
  - Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
- - No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign
    on the fucking doorknob?
  - Lila, it's Rosie.
  - Go the fuck away, Rosie.
  - Please, honey, let me in.
  - Rose, please go away.
  - Lila, I want to help you.
- - How'd you know where I was?
  - Nathan told my brother.
  - Your brother should have his license revoked.
  - Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
  - Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
- - I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
  - Oh, Rosie.
  - Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free
    electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
- - Done!
  - Ready!
- - Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
  - With pleasure.
- - I'm going to miss you.
  - Oh, Rosie.
  - And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
  - Shut up, you.
- - I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for
    business.
  - I'm really glad you two found each other.
- - I'll be in touch.
  - No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
- - My apologies, madam.
  - It's okay, Puff.
  - Shan't happen again.
- - It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
  - It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- - Very well.
  - Very well.
- - We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to
    make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
  - But I like being human now.
- - You what?
  - I want to be the way I was before.
  - Good. I'll show you how, apey.
- - Nice night.
  - Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will
    be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves.
    There is no other reason.
- - You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be
    speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives
    you to let you know he loves you.
  - What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
- - He's dead.
  - We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
  - No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his
    faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as
    anybody.
  - Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never
    talk again period. I love you.
  - Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because
    I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility
    for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
  - I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
  - No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have
    something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed
    into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it
    shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
  - Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the
    whole forest. For both of us.
  - That's what I'm counting on.
  - But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about
    the waywardness of humankind.
  - Okay. If you think it will help.
- - Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no,
    Gabrielle?
  - Oui, doctor, oui.
  - Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
  - Oui.
  - You decide. Today is your day.
  - Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was
    a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie
    very much, monsieur.
  - Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
  - Oui. Perfect!
  - Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle.
    We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
- - Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
  - Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm
    embarrassed that I say this.
- - No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
  - Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
  - Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
  - Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid
    question. I know you are a very important man and...
  - No. Don't be silly. It's just...
  - I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have
    been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless...
    Am I fired now?
- - Thank you so much for accompanying me.
  - Not at all.
  - I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a
    nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
  - Of course not.
  - You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
- - Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
  - I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
- - Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers
    I left.
  - Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang
    up on you?
  - Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
  - No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
  - Is everything fine?
  - Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
  - I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See?
    I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
  - I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
- - Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
  - Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
  - I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I
    was a little girl.
  - When you were a little French girl?
  - Oui.
  - That would be good.
- - Shall we close up, then?
  - Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
  - It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two
    happy coincidences, no?
  - Yes. Happy happy.
  - Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
  - I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
- - I am sleepy.
  - I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
  - Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
  - Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should
    be confident.
  - Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
  - It's true. I wouldn't lie.
  - You are sweet.
- - So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
  - Shh.
- - What is wrong, my darling?
  - Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
- - Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
  - Shit.  Hi, honey.
- - Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to
    do?
  - I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
  - You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
  - Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage
    to admit it to yourself.
- - Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
  - Hmmmph.
  - Gabby, what is it?
  - Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
  - Fine.
  - Not in front of the boy.
  - Very well.
- - My little French.
  - Stop. Get away.
  - What is it?
  - You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice.
    Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
  - Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
  - No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will
    not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous
    side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from
    you.
- - I love you so much, Gabrielle.
  - But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
  - But I don't know how to leave Lila.
- - You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made
    me so hot for you.
  - Unnhh.
  - The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere
    else, too.
  - Urgh.
  - Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
- - Yeah? What?
  - Hi. It's Nathan.
- - Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
  - I just want to talk.
  - We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
- - Please. Just one minute of your time.
  - Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I
    don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
  - I've got some things to tell you.
- - Like what?
  - Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
  - What for?
- - Well, I think...
  - You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than
    he thinks... is what I need!
  - What?
  - You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying
    to you! Go away from here!
  - Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
- - Well?
  - God, you're beautiful.
  - Please. I look a mess.
  - No. You look so beautiful.
  - Anyway. Come already to the point.
  - I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
  - I've moved on.
  - No!
  - I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
  - That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination
    bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
  - That's not how he tells it.
  - Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
  - Hunh.
  - Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I
    don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
  - You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter
    to you, you pig?
- - You were wonderful!
  - Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
  - Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
- - So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
  - Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
- - Lila?
  - That's Lila?
- - A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
  - I don't know. Something's missing.
- - Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
  - I don't know.
- - I want our boy back.
  - Oui.
  - That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us
    famous.
  - We still have you and I.
  - I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better
    way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
  - Where do we look for little lost Puff?
  - I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him
    back into an ape.
  - That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
  - You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their
    forks from their assholes!
- - I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
  - Okay, my sweet. Good night.
  - A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
  - Please let me go with you.
  - No.
  - Okay.
- - Hello, my little boy.
  - Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
  - Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
  - Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
- - Say my name.
  - Gabrielle.
  - You remind me so much of Nathan.
  - Like father, like son.
  - You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
  - Woof.
- - As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have
    you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
  - Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our
    sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was
    erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something
    more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
- - Let's go eat, I'm starved.
  - French?
  - Oui.
- - Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
  - Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
- - I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
  - It's embarrassing, okay?
  - It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
  - Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
  - Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
  - How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
  - Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
  - Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough
    to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive
    troubles?
  - You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something?
    Figure it out for chrissake.
- - And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
  - Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological
    relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But
    you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
- - That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
  - That is the wrong fork, young man.
- - Harold! Tell the boy again.
  - No "buts." Go to your room now.
  - And?
  - And think about what you've done.
- - Tell him, Harold.
  - Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community
    theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
- - Tell him, Harold.
  - It's going famously, son, famously!
- - Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
  - Right.
- - Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch
    of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
  - I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
  - Your Spidey senses tingling.
  - Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
  - You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know,
    like in the comics.
  - How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
  - You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
  - I always favored the Hulk.
  - Hulk was dumb as shit.
  - Aw, fuck.
  - What.
- - Plates match.
  - Call the chief... We found 'em.
- - You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
  - Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop,
    thinks he can help.
  - Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
  - Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's
    missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
  - I guess not.
  - That must be him.
- - Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each
    other with.
  - Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance
    the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
- - Don't worry, we'll find her.
  - Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
- - I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds
    for any sign of anything.
  - Right...  ...come on.
- - Wydell.
  - Excuse me for a second.
- - Over.
  - We found one.
- - Mr. Willis?
  - Yes, sir.
  - I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
- - Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the
    edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
  - That's it?
  - Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood
    to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls
    Dr. Satan.
  - Dr. Satan?
- - What about the body you found?
  - Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
- - Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
  - Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares,
    you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing
    help, ya know?
- - I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
  - I pray to God there is.
- - Hey.
  - George Willis...  ...any leads?
- - Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
  - Fit the profile?
  - No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
- - Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
  - No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
  - My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend,
    he always seemed like a good kid.
- - Turn up this road.
  - Where we headed?
- - Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
  - Shhhh... you hear that?
- - Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
  - Over here, inside the smokehouse.
- - We gotta break it open.
  - I ain't got a warrant.
- - Tell it to my daughter.
  - Shit... fuck procedure.
- - Jesus Christ.
  - Call Wydell.
- - Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
  - Right.
- - Grampa... watch the language.
  - I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming
    about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
- - Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
  - What! God damn, how many?
- - I don't know. I only saw one.
  - I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here,
    take this.
  - What should I do?
  - Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like
    I always fucking do.
- - I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
  - Who's your Daddy!
  - Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
- - Get in... now!
  - Wait, I want to say good-bye.
- - That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
  - Well, go get her.
- - Well hello, officer.
  - Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
  - Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
  - My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
  - Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
  - I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl
    here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
  - Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
- - Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take
    a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
  - I um... no, I don't think so...
  - Please, just a minute.
  - Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
- - Thank you.
  - Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
- - Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
  - No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on
    TV?
- - Why? Why are you doing this?
  - Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at
    hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
  - Where's Bill?
  - Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing...
    I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry
    spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
- - Where is he?
  - Let's go see.
- - Behold... The Fish-Boy!
  - This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
  - Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic
    in my brush strokes.
- - Fuck you, you fucking freak!
  - Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but
    if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
- - What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
  - You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
- - Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of
    Halloween.
  - No, just a little too old.
  - Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
- - I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing
    while in my house, thank you.
  - Sorry.
  - Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve
    and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
- - I suggest you kids leave now.
  - Don't worry, I'm gone.
- - I'm gonna go ask him.
  - Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its
    starting to rain.
  - Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
- - We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
  - Huh?
- - Just back up.
  - I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back
    that way, right?
- - I'll go. It's my fault.
  - You said it, not me.
- - God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking
    bitch.
  - Huh?
  - That stupid hillbilly slut.
  - Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
  - You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
- - Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
  - What!
- - OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
  - Enough with the stupid voices.
- - This is way too fucked up for words.
  - I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
- - I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
  - Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find
    zero.
- - Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
  - His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
  - Oh, right.
  - What do they call you, sweety?
  - Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
- - So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for
    Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
  - Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
  - Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I
    bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
  - I don't doubt that.
- - And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
  - I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
  - I was just kidding.
- - Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he
    walked in.
  - Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
  - Didn't ya think, Mary?
- - I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
  - Firefly.
  - Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend
    of Dr. Satan?
- - For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
  - Oh, you mean on TV.
  - No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first
    to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
  - Great.
- - Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
  - Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
  - Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
- - What'd ya got there?
  - Keys.
  - Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught
    up a tree.
  - Huh?
  - Open up the trunk.
  - Yes, sir.
- - What'd we here, Georgie?
  - A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
  - Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
  - Yeah, no mercy here.
  - Recover any bodies?
  - Not yet.
  - Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
  - Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
  - That's the understatement of the year.
  - Yep, I suppose it is.
- - God damn.
  - You find something, Georgie?
  - Yep, I found something.
- - Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
  - Sleeping.
  - Rise and shine.
  - No please, let me sit this one out.
  - Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
  - I resign.
  - Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
  - Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal...
    it's so crap.
  - Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic
    merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
  - Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
- - I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
  - Tell me about it.
  - God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh,
    my back is killing me.
  - Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
- - It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's
    starting to get brutal.
  - Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her
    dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
  - I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed
    it if I hadn't seen it.
  - A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
  - If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
  - Scattered, smothered and covered.
  - Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
- - Geez, he never gets tired does he.
  - Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before
    me. He's always working on 10.
  - Maybe he's a cyborg.
- - Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
  - Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
- - Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
  - She looks like she stinks.
- - Don't even say it.
  - You got to be fucking joking.
  - God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
- - I think I'm going fucking crazy.
  - I can't believe...
- - She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
  - Yeah, she said we looked queer.
- - How long has it been?
  - I don't know... about half an hour.
- - What was that?
  - What? I didn't hear anything.
  - Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
- - I don't hear anything.
  - Shhhhhh, quiet.
  - I still don't.
  - Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
- - Jesus Christ.
  - I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
- - Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
  - Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
- - A couple hours!
  - Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
- - Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
  - Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
- - Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
  - No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas
    at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into
    a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
  - Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old
    bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
  - Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you
    know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's
    some unsolved mystery around every corner.
  - Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding
    their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on
    a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked
    out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
  - Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all
    the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
  - Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
- - Huh?
  - Grab Mary and come inside.
- - Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
  - Tickets for what?
  - This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
  - I don't want to see that.
- - Aw, come on. It will be fun.
  - Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
- - Ugh, what's that smell?
  - Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
- - Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
  - That seems likely.
- - Fuck, it's freezing.
  - Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
  - Oh, yeah.
  - Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people
    would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about
    tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention
    of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose
    to become an arm-less wonder.
  - Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking
    for a dead tree?
  - It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical
    stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed
    in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
  - So.
  - Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
  - Why?
  - Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only
    to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the
    United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
  - Yeah?
  - These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan
    working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
  - So what?
  - I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
  - You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
  - I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
- - Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
  - When?
  - When you were outside with Bill.
- - Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
  - Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
  - Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
- - Thank you.
  - Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
- - Really, now is not the time to make waves.
  - Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
  - Shhhhhh.
- - What are you laughing at?
  - I don't know, I think he's funny.
  - This isn't funny, it's twisted.
- - You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
  - Shhhhhh.
- - We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
  - Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
  - I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
  - I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
- - That was good babe, just keep doing that.
  - That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
  - Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
  - Help, help us.
- - Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
  - No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody
    we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
- - No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night
    at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
  - That's nice.
  - Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
- - How long is that gonna take?
  - He should be back in a couple hours.
- - Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
  - How's he get around out here?
- - You sure you don't need any help in there?
  - No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this
    kind of work.
- - You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
  - Oh.
  - Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean
    he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on
    us all.
  - What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
  - He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was
    sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant
    to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his
    skin.
- - I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson...
    unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
  - Hmmmmm.
  - Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin'
    on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
  - The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
  - Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden
    in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
- - Fascinating.
  - That kid is one horny retard.
  - Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
  - Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges,
    shit the guy's like forty or something.
  - Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
  - Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is
    twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
  - What?
  - Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
  - I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
  - Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet
    of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
  - Goddamn.
  - Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt,
    couldn't get it out.
  - I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
  - Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
  - Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
  - Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
- - Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
  - I hear ya.
- - Fuck your grandmother.
  - Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick.
    Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
- - Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet...
    if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
  - What I need are some answers.
  - Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind
    his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
  - You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
- - Come on, get with the facts.
  - Hmmmmmmmmm?
  - What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
  - Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around...
    asking stupid questions.
- - And...
  - And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's
    the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves
    turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
  - Is that all... think real hard.
  - Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up
    close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
  - How's about you give me those same directions.
  - Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll
    give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
  - Enough talk, write.
- - We'll need pictures of the inside too.
  - Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
- - Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many
    psychos wandering loose these days.
  - It's a girl.
- - Should we stop?
  - We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next
    rest area.
  - She looks like a freak.
- - Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
  - Where ya headed?
- - Why are we stopping?
  - There's a dog in the road.
- - Go around him.
  - There's not enough room.
  - Then run him over, he'll move.
- - Hey, he moved.
  - Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
- - Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
  - What?
- - Fine. I'll go straight.
  - What!
  - Fine! I'll go straight!
- - Forget it. I'll just go.
  - Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
  - Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
- - I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
  - Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell
    out of here.
- - Check this out.
  - Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
- - This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
  - Just sit back and enjoy the show.
- - How much is a person supposed to stand?
  - Quiet.
  - Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
- - What are you doing!
  - I gotta open the gate.
  - Drive through it!
  - It won't work.
- - I like sleep.
  - Here he comes.
- - Honk at him. Scare him.
  - He won't move.
- - Fuck! We are fucked!
  - Turn that fucking radio off!
- - Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
  - I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
- - What's he so excited about?
  - Yeah, showtime for what?
- - Just grin and bear it.
  - That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
- - Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
  - Man, it's already ten thirty.
- - Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing
    else.
  - I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
- - Don't look back, just get in the car.
  - Lock the fucking doors.
- - Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty
    vibe I know you dig.
  - Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
  - She's pretty cute.
  - Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called
    a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she
    got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
  - There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he
    was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
  - Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
  - If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute
    ain't hot.
  - Yeah, no shit.
  - As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
  - Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
  - Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is
    she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging
    around.
  - I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
  - I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
  - Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty
    Samsonite shit.
  - Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
  - Hot has got nothing to do with it.
- - Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
  - So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"...
    the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you
    ever had."
  - Shit, we really need to find some gas.
  - Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful,
    Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest
    stuff."
  - Yeah.
  - Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then,
    I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
  - Oh yeah, I remember now.
  - Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO
    Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the
    Fantasy."
  - I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run
    out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
  - Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's
    Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline...
    next exit.
  - Perfect.
  - I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter
    12.
- - I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
  - OK, Boss.
- - Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
  - How awesome?
  - Really fucking awesome.
  - Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
  - Hell yeah.
- - Keep straight on this road here.
  - How much further?
  - I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
  - I don't know.
- - Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far
    out of the way to come back to.
  - What's that?
- - It's a hitchhiker.
  - Way out here?
- - She looks like she stinks.
  - Cat fight, cat fight.
- - That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country
    Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
  - Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
  - No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The
    wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole
    thing.
- - What was that?
  - Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
- - OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just
    yet.
  - I'll help ya.
  - Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
- - I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
  - Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out
    to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
  - Jesus Christ, Jerry.
  - Well, technically I did what ya said.
  - You're a real fucking piece of work.
- - Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
  - And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
- - Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
  - Thanks.
  - No problem.
- - Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten
    up... right, Bill?
  - Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking
    killer headache.
  - Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
  - Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
  - Tasted pretty good.
- - I can't believe what I'm seeing.
  - I know, this is fucking nuts.
- - Almost there.
  - Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
- - How long have you been running this place?
  - How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
- - No, really.
  - Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed
    the Oscar.
  - The Duke?
  - Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
  - You mean John Wayne?
  - Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
  - Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
  - I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
  - You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions.
    You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
  - I don't drive cross country.
  - But if you did.
  - I don't.
  - But suppose for a second you did.
  - Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up
    the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
  - No, no I think it's really interesting.
  - Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
- - You all having a Halloween party tonight?
  - Now, what makes you think that?
  - You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
  - Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
  - Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
  - I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
  - Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking
    assholes.
  - Great story Goober, how much?
  - Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
- - Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
  - Holy crap, thanks!
- - Come on, bro. Let's go.
  - Hey, wait take this.
- - What's this?
  - A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some
    day... real weird.
- - No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy
    about animals.
  - The animals have got nothing to do with it.
- - I'd like to see that.
  - Nice.
- - Can I help you with something?
  - I was just wondering.
  - Wondering what?
  - Are you two gals all funny with each other?
  - What?
  - You know... a couple of queers.
  - Do you believe this fucking girl?
  - I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy
    licking bitch.
- - What the hell are you laughing about?
  - I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
  - Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
- - He walks, duh.
  - Fucking great.
- - Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
  - You shouldn't a done that.
  - Why? You gonna do something about it?
  - Yeah, I'll do something.
- - Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
  - Where's that?
  - Couple more miles up this road.
- - What about the tree?
  - Oh yeah, the tree.
- - Which way?
  - Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right...
    it ain't far from there.
- - I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
  - If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
- - OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster
    we get out of here.
  - OK.
- - Don't worry, I'll be right back.
  - Come on.
- - How much further?
  - Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
  - Well, yeah, kind of.
- - The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
  - OK.
- - Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
  - Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
  - Is your brother ready to go?
  - Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
  - He left!
  - Yeah, come on.
- - So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
  - No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps
    a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
  - Um, yeah sure, I guess.
  - You sure do a lot of guessing.
- - Thank you.
  - You're welcome.
- - Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
  - A dead one.
  - Mmmmm, this is tasty.
  - Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
  - I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
  - Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
  - What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
  - Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
  - That's not something to joke about.
  - OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
- - Hey, great they're back.
  - Whoopie fucking doo.
- - Tiny's home.
  - What about R.J.?
  - Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said
    he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
- - Ma, Tiny's in.
  - Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
- - I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
  - Baby! Stop!
- - Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
  - No, I told you...
- - Drink up, it's party time.
  - Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
  - Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
- - Who's your Daddy!
  - Who's your Daddy!
- - Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
  - Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
- - Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain
    for like a hundred million years.
  - Really, that's a long time.
  - Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else
    they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
  - Yikes.
  - Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving
    it around like a drunk monkey.
- - Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can
    show ya.
  - Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
  - Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without
    me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
  - Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
  - Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
  - What?
  - Cone.
  - Huh... what cone?
  - Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
  - I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken...
    smile, say cheese.
  - I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
- - Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all
    bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
  - Cool.
- - The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face
    off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
  - Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
- - I agree.
  - Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
- - Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
  - Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
- - It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
  - My aunt in Australia has offered..
- - It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
  - Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
- - I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
  - I know you mean well.
- - God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
  - I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances.
    Now it's patriotic to be poor.
- - I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
  - You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a
    bed, not really.
- - Molly!
  - Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often
    ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
- - You're having me on, Molly.
  - Am I? Maybe I am.
  - You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
  - Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
- - I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
  - Happy as can be. In the old groove.
- - To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little
    Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
  - Father, that's enough now
  - And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower
    eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
- - What did I do to deserve this?
  - You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
  - How long?
- - What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all
    I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
  - And now we're glad you did.
- - It was the best time of his life.
  - How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
- - I can't do it. What's the point?
  - It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
- - Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
  - Grace!
- - It seems to have survived.
  - Play something, Grace.
- - Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
  - '...since I used to take you to the Proms?'
  - That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
- - Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
  - Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
- - Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
  - A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
- - She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
  - Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did
    it to Clive. Always held something back.
- - It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
  - You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited
    and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
  - Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
- - He could always make me laugh.
  - We did the decent thing.
  - This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give
    myself for once, hold nothing back.
  - We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
  - We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
- - Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
  - You might still have a house.
  - I wish it could all have been different.
  - Look after yourself, Grace.
- - Is it peace in out time?
  - No, Mother! It's War! War!
  - Or what?
- - Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
  - Up to six weeks, I think.
  - How are we going to cope?
- - '...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese
    lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always
    the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.'
  - Wasn't it lovely?
- - I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
  - This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd
    get it started.
  - Just ignore her, Mac.
- - You know it? It must be an old one.
  - Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
  - After this dance.
- - He always knows.
  - Half the time he's bluffing.
- - What would we do if a German came into the house?
  - Don't be silly, Dawn.
  - Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
- - Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
  - The ideas you get in your head.
  - That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different
    now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
- - I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
  - It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun
    when I grow up.
- - And where do you think you're going?
  - Out.
  - You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
  - No, I won't.
- - I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
  - There, there, my baby.
- - You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret
    it for the rest of your life.
  - Who said anything about love?
- - What is it, pet?
  - He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
  - Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
- - What did he say?
  - He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
  - I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
  - Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I
    told him that.
- - I don't believe this is happening to me.
  - It's not. It's happening to me.
- - It looks a bit fishy to me.
  - Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
- - Now take deep breaths, and push.
  - Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
- - No Turks.
  - We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers
    only.
  - They'd gone.
- - We all had to write a last letter home.
  - And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
- - Has Sue got it right?
  - What's that?
  - You joined up.
  - Oh, that.
  - I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say
    it'll be over by Christmas.
- - And what's that?
  - Jam.
- - We don't know anything about it
  - Well, it's off ration. We know that.
  - How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could
    poison half the country.
- - Well?
  - It looks....foreign.
  - Jam is jam! It's just jam!
- - Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
  - You taste it.
- - You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you
    were too old for a commission?
  - That's it.
  - Why didn't they say that before you started?
  - I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
  - What are you going to be then?
  - A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
- - When do you think you'll get leave again?
  - Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
- - I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
  - I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
  - Where to?
- - I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the
    river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
  - Fair enough.  The river.
- - Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
  - Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
- - '...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of
    a coin.'
  - '...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.'
  - '....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he''s out there playing polo
    and sticking pigs.'
- - And Jim.
  - What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
- - Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
  - Weeds will grow, Mac.
  - Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
  - Kiss me Hardy.
- - You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
  - If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
- - What did we know? We were seventeen.
  - I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on
    end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
- - What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid.
    The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against
    the Turks, I knew what it was about.
  - Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
- - What about it?
  - Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
  - Why not?
  - You need trees for an avenue.
  - There was talk of planting some when we first came.
  - Propaganda. We've been had.
- - How's your war, Mac?
  - Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
  - Except the servicemen.
  - Naturally.
  - I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
  - There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot
    of some of our lot at the same time.
- - You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
  - Bugger the Buffs.
- - Don't panic!  Keep your head!
  - I will if you will!
- - So you're going to be a grandfather.
  - And I'm still just a lad myself.
  - Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
- - Here's to music. And absent friends.
  - And absent bridegrooms!
  - And the bride.
- - It was great for me, how was it for you.
  - A bit too quick.
  - Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
  - They might be.
  - I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
- - Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
  - Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
- - Boy, that was some air-raid.
  - Air-raid?
  - Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
- - What is it?
  - We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
  - Where?
  - I don't know?
  - You do, you do. You're just not saying.
  - I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
- - You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring?
    And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
  - Please yourself.
- - What's that?
  - Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
  - Wow!
  - They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell
    costs as much as a Ford 8.
  - Who pays for them?
  - We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
- - Crocodiles! Aah!
  - The sodding water table.
- - But Dad, It's the News.
  - Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
- - Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it?
    Like this.
  - It's like telling fibs.
  - That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else
    does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler
    will hide it. Always remember that, son.
- - You said that last year, Dad.
  - The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting
    batter, and so are we.
- - I did see them. I did.
  - He's the worst liar.
- - You're the biggest fibber.
  - It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
- - The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
  - '...and four and five...'
  - Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
  - '...and six...'
- - Can't we just see the end?
  - They've got the real thing outside.
  - It's not the same.
- - Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
  - I'm starting my own collection.
  - It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
- - Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right.
    It's not patriotic.
  - You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
  - That's not the point.
- - You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
  - Well, for the baby, really.
  - Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
- - He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't
    even know.
  - It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
  - You wouldn't.
  - Would.
  - You couldn't.
  - Could.
- - Go and ask her if she wants to play.
  - Ask her yourself.
  - You do it. You're a girl.
- - Tell them about Pauline's mum.
  - Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
- - Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
  - We thought it was poison.
- - I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
  - It's easy. I've done it.
  - Who with?
  - Pauline.
  - Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when
    they know how.
- - Pauline's mum got killed.
  - No, she didn't.
  - Yes, she did, didn't she?
- - What are you doing here? This is our territory
  - Looking for shrapnel.
- - I never was.
  - Yes, you was. Make him talk.
- - I know a secret.
  - What's that?
  - The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
  - Who told you that?
- - My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going
    missing all the time."
  - They're not.
- - You want to join our gang?
  - I don't mind.
  - Do you know any swear words?
  - Yes.
  - Say them.
- - Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
  - I only know one.
- - That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat
    after me... Bugger off.
  - Bugger off.
  - Sod.
  - Sod.
  - Bloody.
  - Bloody.
  - Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
  - Bugger off, you bloody sod.
  - OK. You're in.
- - They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll
    lose their way.
  - Won't they have maps?
  - They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves
    avay viz ze vay zay tork.
- - What's that?
  - Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
  - So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
- - Can I try?
  - Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
- - Never let a rat creep up on you.
  - I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
- - That was a googly!
  - I know.
  - You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
  - No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
- - Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
  - Why?
  - Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
- - This is going too far, young man.
  - But Grandpa, you said...
  - I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
- - Give him the you-know-what.
  - Very well, Grandpa.
- - You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing
    my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
  - I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
  - Only till they get you into the local school.
  - With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
  - You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
- - It's true.
  - You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
- - Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
  - Apparently so.
- - Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's
    got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street
    and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as
    they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he
    decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops
    chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
  - His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous
    character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are
    going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding
    in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick
    Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him
    and shoots first. That is all.
- - Baldwin -- his name is.
  - I give that marriage six months.
- - Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh,
    Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.
  - Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
  - What's he want?
  - Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
- - The door was locked.
  - She and Mollie were talking.
- - If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
  - It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company
    as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and
    gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company
    goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
- - Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
  - Hello, Mollie.
- - Look out!
  - Look out where you're aiming, will you?
- - Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
  - Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective
    bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every
    other place. Want to go out on it?
- - Get the cops, somebody.
  - Come on, fellas.
- - There she is!
  - Say, Hildy...
- - What's your hurry?
  - We want to see you.
- - Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
  - -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
- - What do you want?
  - I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
  - What's from the Governor?
  - The reprieve for Earl Williams.
- - They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from
    fishing.
  - Get the Governor on the phone!
  - You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
  - Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous
    for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away
    he thinks he's Tarzan!
- - Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
  - Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
  - How much do you make a week?
  - Huh?
  - How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
  - Forty dollars.
- - Who? Me?
  - Who do you think!
- - Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's
    office.
  - The what?
  - The City Sealer's office!
  - You mean here in the city?
  - Yes, yes!
- - Why not?
  - I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
  - But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
  - No, I don't think so.
  - For heaven's sake, why not?
  - I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another,
    they'd lose a grade.
  - No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with
    highest honors!
  - Yeah?
- - This puts me in a peculiar hole.
  - 'No, it doesn''t.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in
    the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don''t let anybody see you.'
  - But how do I know...?
  - Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
  - Pinkus.
  - All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut.
    Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care
    of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on
    account.
- - You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
  - I'll explain it tomorrow!
  - Is it hard?
  - No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
- - Get out of here!
  - You can't bribe me!
- - They wouldn't take it.
  - You're insane!
- - Here's the picture of my wife.
  - A very fine-looking women.
  - She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
  - I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
- - Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
  - They're not human!
  - They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them
    that way.
  - It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
- - Where are they gone? You know where they are?
  - Wait a minute, Mollie.
- - They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
  - Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
  - What do you mean?
- - What's that?
  - Quiet, Mollie!
  - There's somethin' funny going on around here.
- - They'll get him! They'll get him!
  - Ssh!
- - I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
  - I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
- - What's the idea?
  - Never mind! Just play dead.
- - Hey --
  - Shut up, you!
- - Are you all right, now?
  - Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
- - I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
  - You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
  - Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood
    for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're
    hanging me for my beliefs.
  - What are your beliefs, Earl?
  - They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die
    for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine,
    decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
  - How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
  - I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough
    food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
  - '"Production for use only." Well, maybe that''s the answer.'
  - It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose,
    we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in
    restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled
    up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
  - Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
- - A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
  - Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
  - 'Sure. You see, I''d never had a gun in my hand before and I didn''t know what
    to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there''s an answer for everything
    in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what''s a gun for? To shoot!
    So I shot. Simple isn''t it?'
  - Very simple, Earl.
  - There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
  - No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
  - Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
  - Isn't that her picture?
  - Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
- - Don't forget about production for use.
  - I won't, Earl.
- - You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
  - Put down that gun, Earl.
- - You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write
    that story about your "Production for Use".
  - Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
- - Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
  - Don't move!
- - Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You
    can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from
    here.
  - Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't
    want to kill anybody.
  - No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let
    alone.
- - Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
  - What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
  - I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
  - Keep away!
- - Earl, you must never do that again.
  - Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
  - Well, maybe you think I could!
- - Don't talk too loud.
  - Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't
    understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with
    bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't
    you?
  - Sure I do, Earl.
- - Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
  - Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
  - How'd you get here, Earl?
  - Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
- - Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before
    those reporters get back.
  - Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
- - What good'll it do?
  - We'll get you out in ten minutes.
- - Mother!
  - Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked
    up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
  - Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
  - You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay
    here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
- - I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
  - I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
- - Mother!
  - That man there!
  - Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
- - Kings and sixes.
  - That's good.
  - '''Kings and sixes The pot affixes''... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma''s
    knee.'
- - Any dope yet on how he got out?
  - From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
- - Hildy, I thought you were gone --
  - Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what
    I could.
  - Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
- - Hiding him where?
  - Mother!
- - Have you got my dough?
  - Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
  - Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
  - All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
  - Come on with that money!
  - First you got to sign a receipt.
  - Where's the money?
  - Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three
    hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
  - Here!
  - Thanks. So long, Hildy!
  - So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
  - Huh?
  - None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin
    in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked
    his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be
    on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
  - Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is
    this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
- - You know it is!
  - I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose
    it was.
  - No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again
    -- do you?
  - What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
- - You fight it cut.
  - And up a dime.
- - I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
  - Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
  - Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
- - Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
  - But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old
    newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the
    lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
  - Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd
    you get it?
  - I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do
    it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
- - Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
  - I thought so, too.
- - Did you get that, Hildy?
  - No -- what?
- - If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
  - Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
- - Okay.  Forget it.
  - What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll
    cover this end.
- - Look out, you --
  - What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
- - Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
  - What's the matter? Getting yellow?
- - It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a
    bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
  - Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give
    this up so easily.
  - This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver.
    I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter
    dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself,
    Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some
    news that's more important.
- - Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
  - I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? --
    Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind
    because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening
    in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?...
    Oh, fooey on you!
- - Any news?
  - Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
- - Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself --
    the littler the better.
  - Phone for you, Hildy.
  - Who is it?
  - Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
  - Give me that!
- - There goes another scrub lady.
  - I'll go right after it.
- - Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper
    man.
  - Editorials?
- - Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
  - My name is Louis Peluso.
- - Where's the old lady?
  - I'm telling you!
- - We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
  - Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
- - I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin'
    out like oranges!
  - What did you do with her?
  - Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
  - -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
  - Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
- - Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
  - All right, Judge.
- - Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
  - But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch
    on him.
  - And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't
    you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
  - Now, Hildy --
  - Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
  - I can't.
  - All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette
    game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get
    five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
  - Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
  - You can let him out on bail, can't you?
  - Five hundred dollars.
  - You'll take fifty and like it!
  - Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
- - Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
  - That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be
    here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
  - I won't.
  - Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
- - I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
  - Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
- - Got you, Williams!
  - Go on -- shoot me!
- - Pete, I want to talk to you!
  - I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
  - Did you actually give Williams that gun?
  - The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
  - Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
- - Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll
    get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred
    deputies.
  - Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
  - I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
  - Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody
    they see for the fun of it?
  - If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
- - Pete, you're through!
  - What do you mean -- through?
  - I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in
    your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a
    sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
  - Fred!
  - Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
  - Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith
    in human nature.
  - I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
  - Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
  - If there was any way out...
- - That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
  - 'We''re up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: ''Reform
    the Reds With a Rope''.'
- - Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
  - Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
  - I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there
    are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're
    going to lose 'em?
  - But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
- - The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
  - And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else
    knows about this?
- - Pure politics!
  - An attempt to ruin us!
- - Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
  - We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we
    tell 'em?
  - Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
  - Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
  - And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
  - Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
  - What is it?
  - They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded
    -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
  - Tell 'em to hold the wire.
  - I did.  Hold the wire.
  - Cover up that transmitter!
- - No -- don't out me off.
  - How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month.
    That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
- - Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
  - Now what do you say?
- - We'll fix that, too.
  - Just -- one -- second!
- - All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
  - What?
  - Shoot to kill, I said.
  - I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
  - Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
  - Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along...
    No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that
    does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing
    to do.
  - Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
  - If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
- - Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
  - Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
  - A sight for sore eyes!
  - Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But
    that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
  - Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
- - Who is this man?
  - Throw him out, Frank.
- - You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story
    like that!
  - It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
- - That's a lie!!
  - I never saw him before!
- - Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
  - I was just going to!
- - Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for
    Hartwell to fly off the handle.
  - I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
- - And so do I!
  - So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll
    take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
- - I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
  - You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
- - For who?
  - Earl Williams. The reprieve.
- - Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
  - Yeah. But I --
- - Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
  - No, I couldn't do that.
- - Just one second --
  - That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
- - If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
  - This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing
    Squad.
  - What went off?
  - Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
  - A fine fair-weather friend you are!
  - The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
  - After all I've done for you --
  - Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
- - Where is he?
  - Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
- - Same way you did.  Through that gate.
  - I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
  - All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let
    reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might
    do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
  - Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about
    Williams?
  - Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits
    it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
  - Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him
    well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
- - No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
  - You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
  - That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See
    you later.
- - Just a minute, Johnson!
  - Let go o' me. What's the idea?
- - Take your paws off me!
  - Hold her, boys!
- - Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
  - Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
- - I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
  - Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
  - You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
  - I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
  - Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't
    stop me!
- - Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are
    you going to talk or aren't you?
  - What do I know about Williams?
  - All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
- - Where'd you get this?
  - I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
  - Not this gun!
- - He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
  - What?
  - With a bag of marshmallows.
- - He's harmless.
  - Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
  - He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
- - That's murder!
  - All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of
    the cover.
- - How's everything, Gus?
  - I can't complain.
- - Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
  - Little rum in yours, too?
  - I guess so.
- - No -- just coffee, Gus.
  - Just coffee.  And you, sir?
- - Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
  - That's all right.
- - Gus, this --
  - Good coffee, isn't it?
- - I'll call.
  - Three sixes. Is that any good?
- - Goodbye, Yonson.
  - So long, Hildy.
- - What a chase!
  - No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
- - You ain't gettin' out o' here!
  - Now, where is he?
- - We know what you're up to.
  - Probably goin' out to get Williams.
- - That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy
    before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme
    the desk.
  - This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
  - Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
  - Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust,
    and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
- - Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
  - What have you got, Hildy?
- - Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
  - Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
- - She says she's gonna write fiction.
  - Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
- - You guys wanna play some more poker?
  - What's the use? I can't win a pot.
- - Boy, did you see her go?
  - Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
- - No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
  - The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams'
    capture.
  - Call you back.
- - So have we!
  - What's the dope, Sheriff?
  - Who engineered this getaway?
- - Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you
    trying to scoop us or something?
  - Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams
    got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
- - Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her
    some kind of story.
  - I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
- - Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
  - Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
  - Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
- - Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
  - Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
- - Hold the phone!
  - I'll have it in a minute.
- - Well, that about covers everything.
  - Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know
    what he was doing when he fired that gun?
- - Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
  - I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
- - I call. What you got?
  - Three bullets! Any good?
  - Beats king up.
- - Who locked the door?
  - Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
- - Open up there, will you!
  - All right -- all right!
- - Hey!
  - Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
- - Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
  - Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
- - Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
  - Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come
    to.
- - She looks as though she's going to come to.
  - Give me a hand with her, will you?
  - Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
- - A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to
    go after it.
  - It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
- - Better let us in on it, Mollie.
  - Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
- - Are you gentlemen all through with me?
  - Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions
    for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
- - You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible
    for that?
  - The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
  - I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
  - In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
- - Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl
    Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
  - Yes, sir.
- - 'So -- now I say to you: ''Earl Williams, you are under arrest!'' and you point
    your gun at me.'
  - Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
  - Point the gun at me!
- - The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
  - You said it!
  - They're always after me for interviews.
  - Me, too.
  - Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through
    here. You don't mind?
  - Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to
    come from me.
  - We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview?
    I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could
    give them the legal aspects.
  - A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken
    together, Doctor.
  - Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
  - It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
  - Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
- - I don't know --
  - Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's
    going to happen.
- - Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
  - I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
  - No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
- - Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
  - I think it is.
  - I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
- - Cooley, I want to talk to you.
  - Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped
    --
- - There's money in it, Cooley.
  - I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
  - A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
- - How much?
  - Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
  - It's a deal. Let me up.
- - Let's see the money.
  - First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
- - Walter!
  - I'm busy, Duffy.
  - Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
  - What?
  - And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
  - You're crazy. Where's Mac?
  - He's on my phone. He just called me.
  - They can't do that to me!
- - Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
  - Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue
    in your head.
- - Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this
    isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
  - Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
- - Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
  - Take that mush out of your mouth!
- - Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over
    to the cops!
  - What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the
    street.
  - Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
  - I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
- - You stay here. I'll find out everything.
  - Western an' Thirty-fourth.
- - Anything you want, Boss.
  - Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
  - Who do you want?
  - Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them
    anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
- - You know me. The shirt off my back.
  - You got plenty of money?
  - Sure, boss.
  - I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
  - I always have both.
- - Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't
    take to anyone on the way.
  - What's that -- what's that?
- - Are you referring to me, Madam?
  - You know you did!
- - Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
  - I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding
    him!
- - Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
  - You grey-haired old Judas!
  - Let me out! Let me out of here!
- - What do you want?
  - Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's
    no longer your wife.
  - Hello, Hildy!
  - Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
- - How long is what?
  - You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
  - Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I
    guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
  - Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
  - No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old
    girl now.
  - Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
- - You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "--
    any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
  - I notice you still remember it.
  - I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
  - You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
  - Done what?
  - Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives
    him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
  - Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
  - Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last
    forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today.
    It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between
    us nothing can change.
  - I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't
    such a stinker.
  - Now, that's a nice thing to say.
  - Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum
    up the whole works?
  - Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the
    well runs dry.
  - 'A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  ''Hildy: Don''t be hasty --
    remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge
    ran out to watch it.'
  - Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place
    -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
  - What home?
- - Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in?
    I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
  - All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I
    spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting
    food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
  - Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
  - Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of --
    Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a
    dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm
    --
  - Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and
    if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
  - What?!!
  - I haven't any hard feelings.
  - Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping
    quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
  - Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
  - I have a lunch date. I just want --
  - You can break it, can't you?
  - No, I can't.
  - Sure you can. Come on.
  - Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband
    and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
  - What do you mean by that?
  - Just what I said. That's what I --
  - You mean you're not coming back to work here?
  - That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
  - You've had a better offer, eh?
  - You bet I've got a better offer.
  - Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for
    --
  - I know, Walter, but I --
  - What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a
    School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
  - You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
  - Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man
    could look at without shuddering.
  - Listen, Walter --
  - I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any
    other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs
    both of us.
  - Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't
    work out, Walter.
  - It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter.
    But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
  - I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
  - Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke
    down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman
    you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
  - You -- you --
- - Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat!
    Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How
    do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this
    has to be the day.
  - What's the matter?
  - Sweeney.
  - Dead?
  - Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and
    his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
  - Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
  - I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams
    case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left
    in this country?
  - Well, haven't you got anybody else?
  - There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
  - No!
  - You've got to help me, Hildy.
  - Keep away --
  - It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
  - That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
  - Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do
    it for me! Do it for the paper.
  - Get away, Svengali.
  - If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll
    raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
  - Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
  - All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
  - Please! Will you just --
  - Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
  - I'm not working for any other paper!
  - Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like
    it. Trying to blackjack --
  - Look at this!
- - I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married,
    Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get!
    I'm through.
  - Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
  - You can't sell me that, Walter.
  - Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
  - That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
  - I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
  - A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking
    people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going
    to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got
    chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going
    around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls
    and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
  - Where'd you meet this man?
  - Bermuda.
  - Bermuda... Rich, eh?
  - Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
  - What's his line?
  - He's in the insurance business.
  - The insurance business?
  - It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
  - Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
  - Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't
    treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
  - He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
  - I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet
    and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
  - Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
  - Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
  - Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
  - The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So
    long, Walter, and better luck next time.
  - I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
  - Thanks...
  - Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife
    marries.
  - Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
  - Say, could I meet him?
  - Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
  - You're not afraid, are you?
  - Afraid? I should say not!
  - All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
  - Better.
- - Then what does he want with you?
  - Now you got me.
  - Nothing personal. I was just asking.
- - You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
  - No kidding?
- - And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
  - What for?
  - And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
  - Oh, I'm sorry.
- - Allow me.
  - Thanks.
- - I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's
    your last fling.
  - How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's
    the thanks I get!
- - Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking
    at you.
  - I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
  - Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't
    give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that
    goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
- - Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
  - Thank you.
- - What now?
  - His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They
    can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
  - You said it.
  - So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
- - If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
  - Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
  - The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
  - Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
- - No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter,
    I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring
    it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're
    still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks
    just the same.
  - I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you
    could. It needs a woman's heart --
  - Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
  - You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her --
    otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
- - How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember
    that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours!
    I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight --
    and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
  - What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
  - What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
  - Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
  - What do you mean?
  - I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins
    this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
  - All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
  - We're not interested.
  - Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me
    and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
- - Now you're talking!
  - You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll
    get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You
    phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview
    and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks,
    Walter!
  - What tricks would I pull?
  - Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would
    be his first payment on that policy?
- - What do you think I am -- a crook?
  - Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
  - All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
  - No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and
    hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun
    to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
- - Exclusive? That's great.
  - It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
  - Never mind that. What's the story?
  - Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
  - You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right
    down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
  - Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
  - I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
  - Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact
    the crime --
- - Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact
    the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great
    thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
  - No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
  - No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The
    Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl
    gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer
    wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll
    recover.
  - That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll
    see you get it in fifteen minutes.
  - It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab
    and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
  - Hold on a minute.
- - Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
  - Yes. Where is he?
  - She jumped out of the window.
  - I know. Where is he, I said.
- - Where do you think you're going?
  - Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have
    to do this to me?
  - Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably
    in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't
    desert now!
  - Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page
    -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered
    your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting
    out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
  - You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred
    and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have
    you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got
    the whole city by the seat of the pants!
  - I know, but --
  - You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered
    -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone
    discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!
  - Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
  - Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've
    taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang
    and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same
    kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys
    out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even
    their wives!
  - I'd like to think.
  - Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to
    keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive.
    Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
  - I get it!
  - You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor
    and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another
    in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching
    about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still
    a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
  - Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
  - Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll
    be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By
    tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards
    now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
  - Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll
    --
  - We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
  - That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
- - Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
  - You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
  - We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
- - Hildy!
  - Huh!
  - Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap
    into it!
  - How much do you want on it?
  - All the words you've got.
  - Where's some paper?
- - Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
  - Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
- - How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
  - Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the
    world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
- - For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
  - Okay, Walter.
- - Hildy!
  - All right, Walter.
- - Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away?
    You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
  - Where's Butch?
- - Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
  - Where's Bruce?
  - Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
  - What tickets?
  - Railroad tickets.
  - Is he coming back here?
  - Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
- - Double-crossing swine!
  - You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving
    notice after this.
- - Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
  - I'm finished.
  - Finished!
- - Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
  - Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
- - Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
  - What did you do with her?
  - What happened?
  - You been in a fight?
- - Where is she? Tell me!
  - Louie!
- - Don't tell me -- was she killed?
  - Was she? Did you notice?
- - It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
  - What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
  - If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it!
    Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
  - I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face
    him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
- - Look at me, Hildy --
  - I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
  - If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
  - Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
- - Hello -- hello...
  - Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
  - Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
  - Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
  - What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
  - Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
  - Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
  - Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
  - I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
  - Is this the Community Hospital?
  - I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are
    at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
  - Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
  - Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross
    me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello,
    Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from
    his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock
    your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around
    with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
  - Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
  - Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better
    than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
- - Lafayette two-one-hundred.
  - That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this
    to me -- at a time like this?
- - Ring that number, will you?
  - Come here. See if we can move it.
  - Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident
    in the last --
  - Will you come here?
  - Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
  - When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down
    on me, are you --
  - Yes.
- - Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
  - I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going
    out and find her!
- - Don't open that!
  - Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
- - No, you don't! Walter!
  - What is it? Here!
- - No!
  - Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
- - Wait a minute!  Let go there!
  - Murder, uh?
  - Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
- - When did you deliver this first?
  - Who did you talk to?
- - Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
  - Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
  - And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
- - How was that for a tight squeeze?
  - Don't tell me you were worried!
  - Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
  - Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us.
    Well, it's been a lot of fun.
  - In a way.
  - I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through,
    Hildy.
  - We've certainly been in some swell jams.
  - Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
  - Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory?
    Six scoop interviews!
  - Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician.
    We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
  - We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
  - In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
  - Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
- - Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
  - That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
  - Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you
    want to write this story yourself.
  - Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't,
    Walter.
  - Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later
    train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
  - Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
  - He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another
    hour?
  - I don't know what to do, Walter.
  - Flip a coin.
  - All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
- - Well -- what is it?
  - What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
- - Hildy!
  - Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
  - Then why are you doing it?
  - Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
- - The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
  - Thanks.
  - And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave,
    Hildy!
  - Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
  - What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
  - No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
  - Where'd you wire him?
  - On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
  - Sure.
  - It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection
    -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap
    reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
  - Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
  - Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
  - Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages.
    It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world.
    Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in
    the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
  - A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon
    in a coal mine!
  - That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon
    and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But
    us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
  - Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
  - Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara
    Falls?
  - Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
  - Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
  - Walter!
  - Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this
    paper.
  - What would you do if it was a daughter?
  - Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't
    be such a bad combination.
  - What's the matter with my brains?
  - What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look,
    Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
  - Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
  - I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
- - What!
  - Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
- - That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
  - Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
  - You're not fooling anybody.
- - How about Bruce's?
  - Walter, you can't do that!
  - 'Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with
    all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."'
- - Hildy, darling!
  - Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going
    to be like.
  - It'll be Heaven!
  - Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in
    -- to get a new story for your paper!
- - But, Hildy -- I can explain --
  - You -- you!!
- - Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
  - Your luck's not with you now!
- - Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
  - All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
  - This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
  - The power of the press, huh!
- - That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
  - Out of the mouths of babes.
  - He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has
    really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
- - Save that for the Tribune.
  - What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
- - Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
  - You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor
    of.
- - If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise,
    I'll have to ask you to get out.
  - You'll ask me to what?
  - Get out!
  - Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
- - I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams
    I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
  - Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that
    Earl Williams shot his way out with!
- - You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
  - I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
- - No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
  - Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what
    you're doing?
  - I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and
    so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars
    for this.
  - You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
  - We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
- - Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
  - You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
  - I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
  - We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys.
- - What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
  - Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
- - Call Duffy!
  - No, you don't!
  - Do you want to get us scooped?
- - You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling
    your nose out of the feed bag.
  - Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing --
    making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell.
    Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds
    and I want to take their confessions.
- - What's this?
  - Get out of here, you!
- - Mr. Burns --
  - I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
  - I'm Bruce Baldwin!
- - You're Bruce Baldwin?
  - Yes!
  - Then who are you?
- - This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
  - ''
  - Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I
    call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
  - Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
  - You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to
    expect that she was marrying a much older man.
  - Oh.
  - But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
  - Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
  - That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
- - Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
  - Where are we going?
  - Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
  - No -- she didn't.
  - Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy,
    my treat!
- - Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
  - Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and
    tomorrow we'll be married.
  - Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
- - Mother? But your mother --
  - No. My mother.
  - Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
- - I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
  - I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting
    myself.
- - Well, I'll try to give her one.
  - I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
  - Just for the first year.
  - That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
- - Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
  - Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor
    back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was
    in town...
- - How's business, Bruce?
  - Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty
    early in life.
  - I don't blame them.
- - I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter.
    Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
  - Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really
    helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward
    -- that's what counts.
  - I see what you mean.
- - Anything the matter?
  - Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
- - Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
  - It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who
    was coming after him to quiet him down.
- - Are you sure Williams is not all there?
  - All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother
    to be re-elected.
  - But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
  - How?
- - How long would the interview take?
  - Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
  - We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
- - I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
  - You haven't seen anything yet.
- - I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
  - Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
  - I feel I ought to take care of her.
  - 'Well, you''ll take care of her. After all, if that doctor''s right, I''m going
    to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very
    bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she''d wanted to, but she
    wouldn''t take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.'
  - Well, I'm independent, too.
  - 'Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you''ll
    probably have made enough so that the money won''t mean anything. But suppose
    you haven''t made good -- don''t you think Hildy''s entitled to a quiet old age
    without any worries?'
  - Well, of course, if you put it that way.
  - And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
  - I'm beginning to realize that.
  - And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe
    she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
  - Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
  - No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came
    on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
- - Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
  - Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
- - Well, she'll know some day.
  - That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
- - Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
  - Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
- - Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
  - Thanks a lot.
- - Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
  - Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
  - Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
  - So long.
- - Hildy!
  - What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where
    you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it...
    what's that?
- - No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
  - Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
- - And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around
    here...
  - Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
- - I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
  - If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
- - I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman,
    after all.
  - Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last
    couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything
    about it.
  - Ts! Ts! Ts!
  - And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
  - I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job.
    Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother.
    What does she look like?
  - She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
  - That's the kind of stuff they want!
- - Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
  - The money? Why?
  - There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
  - Gee! Take a look, will you?
- - Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
  - Say, I want to be sure, too!
- - I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
  - Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
- - I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
  - Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I
    can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with
    did very little spoiling.
  - I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
  - My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
  - I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
  - I'll come a-running, pardner.
- - Oh, it isn't like that.
  - It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
- - You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
  - You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
  - Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot
    of charm.
  - He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
  - If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right
    off my feet.
  - That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the
    floor.
- - Too hot?
  - No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
- - Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
  - He certainly -- hic -- does!
- - I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
  - Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
  - Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
  - And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
  - But --
  - According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole
    year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing
    to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
  - I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
- - About twenty-five hundred dollars.
  - Better make that a certified check, Walter.
- - All right, dear.
  - Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
  - The five hundred? Sure.
  - On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
  - But --
  - Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
  - But I don't gamble, Hilda!
  - I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please,
    dear.
  - All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
  - I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
- - Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
  - Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not
    here -- I'm in a phone booth.
- - All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
  - Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
- - What's the matter?
  - I lost my wallet.
  - The check, Bruce!
- - That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper
    superstition.
  - Yes, wasn't it?
  - I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
  - I'm sure you haven't any.
  - For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized
    he couldn't have been.
  - Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
  - Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that
    out.
  - Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next
    train, this time I mean it!
  - Did you finish the interview?
  - The Criminal Courts Building.
- - No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
  - But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
  - Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over
    with a messenger.
- - Hildy!
  - Hello, Bruce...
- - BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
  - Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
  - Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
- - I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred
    dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they
    sent it to the police station!
  - We'll explain the whole thing to them.
  - I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care
    much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
  - Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
- - Oh, she was here.
  - Where'd she go?
  - Out some place.
- - Hildy! Where's mother?
  - Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
  - Did you give her the money?
  - No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
  - Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
  - Oh, yes. Here it is.
- - Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
  - Thank you.
- - Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's
    your wallet. I got it back.
  - You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
- - I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
  - Fine.
- - Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite
    an honor having you come over here.
  - Hello, Bensinger.
  - Excuse me, I just want to --
- - How do you mean?
  - I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
  - Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
  - I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
  - Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
  - The poem?... The poem was great!
  - Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart
    he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's
    tears..."
  - Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
  - What?
- - Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
  - No. Roy. Roy V.
  - Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably
    never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How
    much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
  - Seventy-five.
  - I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
- - Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point
    of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every
    sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're
    closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
  - Sort of a Jack London style?
  - Exactly!
- - I got my rhyming dictionary in --
  - It doesn't have to rhyme!
- - I'll keep you in mind.
  - Au revoir, mon capitaine.
  - Bon jour!
- - Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
  - Hildy!
- - Are you back?
  - No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for
    myself.
  - What doing?
  - I'm getting married tomorrow.
  - Well, congratulations! Good luck!
- - Who is it?
  - What's the idea of locking this?
  - That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
- - Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
  - Open this door!
- - Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
  - Why don't you fellows get your own news?
- - This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
  - A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals,
    and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals
    at the hour of execution.
  - Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect
    the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up
    a dime.
  - The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says
    nothing can interfere with his duty.
  - And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has
    written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on
    account of the misspellings.
- - When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
  - The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
  - Oh yes, more than enough.
- - You're one of William's kids, huh?
  - His only kid.
  - Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
  - We were very close.
  - The resemblance is amazing.
  - When may I expect the cleaners?
  - I'll send them right up.
- - Morning Mr. North
  - Same.
  - Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind
    you I'm 74 now.
  - No.
  - Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that
    count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
  - I'm sure that's true.
- - Nothing to be sorry about.
  - Just your pappy scared some.
- - Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
  - I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
  - You're a kind man to be sure.
  - I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
  - Steven, Conor didn't die.
  - But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
  - They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through
    and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
- - This your present address?
  - Yes.
  - Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
  - I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
  - Did you know the victim?
  - No.
  - His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
  - It doesn't.
  - He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
- - Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in
    the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
  - American.
- - Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
  - What are you getting at?
  - Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well
    dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
- - What were _you_ looking for?
  - That's none of your business.
  - You're wrong.
- - Do you know what this is?
  - I presume it's a sword.
  - A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
  - Your murder weapon?
  - It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
  - A mystery.
  - For the moment.
- - My condolences.
  - Where were you Tuesday night?
  - Home.
  - A neighbor saw your car leave.
  - He's mistaken.
- - Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good
    idea.
  - Do you?
  - All I need is time.
  - I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me,
    Lieutenant.
- - We have some unfinished business.
  - Are you here?
  - I want you to come to me.
  - And if I refuse?
  - Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
- - Yes laddie, I have her.
  - Should I care?
- - Long time.
  - Not so long.
- - You've been here from the start.
  - My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
- - Friend of yours?
  - Of sorts.
  - I do hope she enjoys a good show.
- - Run!
  - MACLEOD!
- - You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
  - Leave her out of this.
  - As you wish.
- - What's the point?
  - This isn't done.  Get up.
  - What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
  - I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
  - Tradition.
  - It's all we have.
  - Go to hell.
- - Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
  - Leave her alone.
  - Get up.
- - Spare a chair?
  - Kahn?
  - Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
  - Sit.
- - How are you?
  - Head still secure to the neck.
  - How did you find me?
  - How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
- - Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But
    it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
  - What are you doing here?
  - It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
- - And have you something to settle with me?
  - Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
  - It's good to see you, Kahn.
- - I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold"
    turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
  - Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
  - But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross,
    climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell
    is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
  - Offered the Pope one of his whores.
- - Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
  - Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world
    down around his ears.  Not like now.
- - He found us even there.
  - He always did.
- - I haven't drunk this much since-
  - -Since you last saw me.
- - I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
  - You were never a kid.
- - I knew his great-grandfather.
  - You're insane.
  - No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
  - How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
  - Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just
    marking time.  You're marking time.
  - I've had a few more concerns.
- - The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
  - You're wrong.
  - You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
- - Where!
  - I don't know.
  - What name is he using?
- - Smith.  Carl Smith.
  - How many came?
  - The last four.
  - And the Bulgarian?
  - He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
  - He knows I'm here.  How?
  - None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
- - _Answer_ me.
  - We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to
    New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
- - I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
  - Figure she's with him?
  - Yeah.
  - We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
  - Any other I.D.s come up?
  - Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never
    know.
- - Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart
    of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
  - You'd think he'd had practice.
- - Are you sure?
  - Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks
    good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but
    had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
  - Round up who you can and put them on standby.
  - Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
  - No.  I want this to be all ours.
- - Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
  - Thanks.
- - Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At
    the top, hiding in old leaves.
  - Where did you learn that?
  - My father taught me.
  - Your father must be smart.
  - Yes, he was.
- - Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
  - Have you time for some- thing to eat?
- - Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the
    Duke.
  - Must he go?
  - Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
  - But Ian, he's still but a boy.
  - He's a MacLeod.
- - Your name?
  - Mulet.
- - I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
  - Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
  - What is your position?
  - Second musketeer.
  - I understand you joined up in Bremen.
  - You seem to understand a great deal.
  - I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
  - Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
  - Equals?
  - If you wish to play games, Major.
- - Wait.  I think we understand each other.
  - We have no understanding.
  - Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
- - Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
  - It can be different.  It must be.
  - It never changes, Major.
- - We must talk.
  - Stay out of it.
  - Don't threaten me, Private.
  - Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten
    you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your
    life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness.
    It's what we live for.
- - Do not turn your back on me.
  - You are really going to force this, aren't you?
  - Either you are with me or against me.
- - You see Major?  You are not so different...
  - I had no choice.
- - Complete your inspection?
  - They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
  - I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
  - We need more time.
  - Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
- - Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
  - Not likely.
- - Who am I deceiving?
  - Certainly not me.
- - State of grace and all that.
  - Tradition.
  - It's all we have.
- - Not so scared.
  - Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head
    is stranger to his neck.
  - No doubt.
  - You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man
    of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit-
    ion.
  - You're wrong.
  - I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make
    itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was
    destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
- - Romirez understood.  Not you.
  - Romirez is dust.
- - Finish your prayers?
  - Finish yours?
  - Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who
    truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
  - So sure?
- - Oh please.  Another one.
  - What would you like?
  - Something pretty.
  - Like you.
- - That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
  - Far away.
  - Kiss me.
- - David.
  - Do you have cause to bothering us?
- - I'm your future husband, remember?
  - I have no future husband.
  - I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
- - My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
  - What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
  - You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half
    as bad and lived.
  - But I did live.
  - Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
  - So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On
    us.
  - Some think not.
  - Who?
  - There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
  - That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
  - I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
  - You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
  - Me father has taken back my hand.
- - Please not be touching me, Conor.
  - I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But
    not from you.
  - Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
  - You're not talking sense, Mara!
- - If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
  - Do what you must.
- - Afternoon.
  - Your name is Conor?
  - Aye.
  - Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
  - You're not from these parts.
  - I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
- - I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's
    here.
  - Please go to no trouble.
- - Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
  - Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
  - Your marks would suggest great injury.
  - I was nearly killed.
  - But you lived.
- - I did at that.
  - And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
  - Aye.
  - I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps
    giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
- - I was driven out.
  - And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
  - How can you know this?
  - First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
- - Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
  - Pheasant.
  - You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the
    food is so...domestic.
  - Why are you here?
  - I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of
    metal.
  - You're a long way from Inverness.
  - In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from
    the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
  - You know me home.  Me name.
  - It was time for our paths to cross.
- - When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would
    die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price
    for being different.
  - You are the same?
  - Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
  - Yes.  Always.
  - Does it change with me in the room?
  - It is less.
  - You feel you know me.
  - I don't know why.
  - We are brothers.
- - He told me there could be only one.
  - 'Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their
    lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others
    around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man,
    but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.'
  - I don't understand.
  - You are still so very young.
  - I'm twenty-two.
  - Not even a single lifetime.
- - Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
  - What?
  - We are immortal.
- - It is as you are.
  - No!
- - Listen to me.  Hear the words.
  - This is madness!
  - It is the truth.
  - No!
- - Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
  - This can't be.
  - You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
  - This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
  - You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
- - What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
  - You will live.  Survive.
  - Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
  - You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
  - Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
- - Why does he want to kill me?
  - You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
  - Aye.
  - It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push
    would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long
    as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
  - But we cannot be killed.
  - There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your
    neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then
    it is over.  The end.
  - How can I stop such a man?
  - Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend
    yourself.  In this I can help.
  - Why?
  - We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
- - Harder.  Concentrate harder.
  - Me arm hurts.
  - Again.  Try again.
- - Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
  - Go to hell.
  - Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
- - Impotent cow.
  - Muy Bien!
- - It will take less effort as you learn.
  - It's like to kill me first.
- - You have a gift.  One you must protect.
  - And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
  - The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation
    to another.
  - If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've
    failed.
- - You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
  - Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
- - What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
  - All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
- - As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future
    life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every
    living thing.
  - I do not think I like the sound of that.
  - It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of
    such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength
    of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been
    to what will always be.
  - I feel hardly nothing.
  - You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I
    can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
  - But why be so concerned about me?
  - This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the
    cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
  - And you?
  - I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being
    the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
  - I am not ready for this.
  - You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never
    attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You
    will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly
    Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will
    see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic
    lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their
    greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to
    truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the
    others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each
    other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do
    not become one of them.
  - Of course.
  - You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap
    all pity, all love.
  - That is not me.
  - With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil
    one.
- - Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
  - I'll be back when I can.
- - Requiem acer'nam donaei-
  - What are you doing man?
  - -Et lux perpetua-
  - You'll not be bringing the church into this.
  - -Luceat ei-
- - Be quiet.
  - -Auditorium nostrum-
  - Stop.
  - -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
  - Stop!
- - I don't believe him.
  - Why?
  - He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
- - Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your
    uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
  - I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of
    peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
- - Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He
    has one, he might have two.
  - You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
  - Give it a rest Ned, huh?
- - Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
  - All I need is for you to check the name.
  - You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just
    dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
  - I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
- - Corey, you _owe_ me.
  - It's that important?
  - Yeah.
- - Good way to lose your job.
  - Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't
    written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
  - I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
  - It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to
    here with it.
  - You always were hard to impress.
- - Who is it?
  - Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
- - A murder.
  - You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking
    your fingers into it.
  - I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
  - What do you want from me?
  - Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently
    skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert
    on missing persons.
- - I'm calling an attorney.
  - You and I should talk first.
  - We've got nothing to say.
- - What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four
    people?
  - Four?
  - All fashionably without heads.
  - Spare me the details.
  - But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator
    in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise
    surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the
    ever popular Richard Taupin.
  - What are you getting at, Moran?
  - You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church
    Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you
    didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering
    book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
  - It'll never stick.
  - But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups,
    it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out
    neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
  - You're an asshole, Moran.
  - I want Taupin.
  - What makes you so sure he's the one?
  - Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the
    corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for
    humanitarian of the year.
  - What's all of this got to do with me?
  - What were you doing in Felton?
  - Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
  - I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
  - Never take up poker, Detective.
  - Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
- - Forget it.
  - I'm just curious.
  - You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
- - Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
  - Now there's a new topic.
  - Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
- - Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who
    died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to
    pass some bad checks then dump it.
  - Thanks.
  - Call your mother.  You never call her.
- - Do you play?
  - Yes.
  - Very traditional.
- - Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
  - I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
  - It's not mine.
  - It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after
    all these years.
  - Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little
    I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to
    do.
- - Byzantine?
  - Basil the II.
  - Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
  - -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now
    if you will please-
- - Good reflexes.
  - Good day, Miss Cartwright.
- - Someone beat you.
  - Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
  - Grave robbers?
  - Probably.
  - Who?
  - People like that rarely leave business cards.
  - Does Carl Smith?
- - I don't know what you're talking about.
  - I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing
    was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows
    that.
  - You have an active imagination.
  - I've been to Church Hill.
  - Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I
    strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
- - I have friends.
  - I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
- - Jesus Christ.
  - You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
  - Why not?
  - Tradition.
  - What the hell is going on?
- - He tried to kill me last night.
  - Where?
  - Dupont Circle.
- - Who is he?
  - At the moment?  Carl Smith.
  - And you?
- - What will you do now?
  - You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
  - He called you "MacLeod".
  - Not your concern.
  - I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
  - That bothers you?
  - He was innocent.
  - He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
  - What about me?
  - You?
  - I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's
    chop list.
  - Have you gone to the police?
  - No.
  - Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
  - I'd rather hear yours.
  - You are being foolish.
  - I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the
    face.
  - Go home.
- - He sees me as a threat.
  - Are you?
- - No.
  - No one knows you're here?
  - No.  I had to talk to you.
  - You had to do _nothing_!
  - You're wrong.
  - You're a fool.
  - Maybe.
- - Is this what you killed them with?
  - You've been listening to rumors.
  - Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
  - You are.  Now.
- - What's all that?
  - Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
- - You did kill those men.
  - Not all of them.
  - When you finish, what then?
  - I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
  - You make it all sound so simple.
  - The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've
    aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance
    at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
  - You want me to front for you.
  - The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs.
    Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
- - There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than
    anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as
    the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it
    wasted.  You love history?
  - Yes.
  - I wish I could.
- - The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance
    at the county seat.
  - It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
- - No.  So what now?  We just wait?
  - Yes.
  - Well, as long as we're stuck here.
- - It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
  - They do it each year.
  - I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
- - Maybe it would do us both good.
  - There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
- - Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
  - It's beautiful.
  - A little dusty.
- - I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
  - Follow me.
- - William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
  - Yes.
  - And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
  - Yes.
- - You're using your son's name.
  - No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put
    them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
- - Then you must be at least 70 years old.
  - At least.
  - That's impossible.
- - It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
  - A factor of age.
  - I hope I never get that old.
  - You won't.
- - I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A
    very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
  - Why are you here?
  - I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But
    it's not.  It's you.
  - I see.
  - I'm not even sure why.
  - Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
  - My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I
    can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
  - You are a very perceptive young woman.
  - Just a little crazy.
- - Who are you?
  - That would be difficult to explain.
  - I'd like you to try.
- - I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report
    for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from
    Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
  - That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
  - Yes.
  - He knows about you.
  - He is older than I.
  - What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
  - Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something
    to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing
    to replace the love that can never work.
  - That's insane.
  - Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
  - Of bodies.
  - I didn't kill the watchman.
  - You killed those other two.
  - Not the same.
  - What about that family in '31?
  - Sometimes innocents become involved.
  - You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in
    iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
  - There are differences.
  - You kill with your left hand?
  - I haven't killed _you_.
  - Is that a threat?
- - Don't.
  - Come here, Brenna.
  - Damn you.
- - What is it like?  Being you?
  - Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would
    love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
  - But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
  - It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
  - What is it you want?
  - All of it finished.
- - Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
  - Will I see you again?
  - Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
- - What's wrong?
  - I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
- - What is it?
  - I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
- - Get out.
  - No!
  - I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
- - The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the
    quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
  - The inheritance.
  - Not power.  Not control.
- - Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
  - You have lived forever.
  - Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The
    gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you
    Brenna.
- - It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can
    promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love,
    is that not worth a lifetime?
  - Yes.
- - This is against the rules.
  - So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
  - -Okay okay.
  - You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
- - Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received
    first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
  - Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
  - Anything in Maryland is close.
- - Would you like more tea?
  - No thank you, I'm fine.
- - He was unsual.
  - Why?
  - Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies
    I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through
    when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
  - Then you didn't know Richard later on.
  - No.
  - I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family
    might have had with museums or historical societies.
  - Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
  - I don't follow you.
  - Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days
    after he was born.
  - The boy _died_?
  - Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never
    even saw her son.
- - Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
  - There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I
    heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
  - Would you remember his name?
  - Carl Smith.
- - That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
  - There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau,
    fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry
    of that somehow always appealed to me.
  - You're very macabre.
  - It's my birthday.
  - Happy birthday.
  - Thanks.
- - Doesn't have a head, does he?
  - This one came unassembled.
- - How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
  - Fine.
- - Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
  - Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
  - Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
  - Claymore.
  - Huh?
  - Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means
    business, and you've got a claymore.
  - You're the expert.
  - It's in good condition.
- - I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since
    1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
  - Maybe he's hiding from something.
  - Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around
    with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District
    anyway.
- - Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
  - Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like
    Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
  - How old is Richard?
  - P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
  - Find the father.  That should clear things up.
- - Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
  - Yeah.
  - He'd want to know about all this.
  - Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this
    somewhere.
  - Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
- - Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
  - Sure.
- - I warned you.
  - Go to hell.
- - Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto,
    Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
  - Naw.  Those are for us.
  - Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
- - I think you have more.
  - Well we don't.
  - I can't frisk you but the cops can.
- - Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your
    criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
  - No, we...
- - Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio --
    deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed
    to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the
    plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
  - Records are those big round black things, right?
  - Fuck off.
- - It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll
    take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping
    expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
  - Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead
    for one plane ride.
  - We're not there yet, Justin.
  - I'm Vince.
  - Whatever.
- - We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
  - Nice.
  - What's the name of your label?
- - What do you think?
  - It's the best collection I've ever seen.
  - Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
- - These are worth at least, I don't know --
  - I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
  - But you must have --
  - I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
  - And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
  - He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He
    had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him
    to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check
    for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you
    make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
  - It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
  - Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
- - Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send
    him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
  - That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
  - Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
  - Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
  - That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth
    five times that.
  - Sixty.
  - Thirteen hundred.
  - Seventy-five.
  - Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
  - And I won't take a penny over ninety.
- - With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
  - I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
  - Fine.
- - Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
  - Sure.  Ten cents.
  - Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest
    away for all I care.
  - Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But
    that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
- - Yeah?
  - Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
- - Hi, Mom.
  - Everything all right?
  - Great.  Super-fantastic.
  - How's the store?
  - So so.  Up and down.
  - Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of
    us would ever sleep...
- - She left.  She's gone.
  - What do you mean?  Where did she go?
  - How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move
    out.
  - Well call her mother.
  - She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever
    hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house,
    you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe,
    and... I dunno...
- - Hello?  Anybody there?
  - I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
  - You know that's not what's upsetting me.
  - Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
  - I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
  - I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow
    I'll get up and go to work.
  - And after that?
  - Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have
    it all sorted out.
  - I knew this was going to happen.
  - Then what are you getting so upset about?
  - What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
  - It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
  - So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
  - Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She
    is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
  - Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in,
    she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
- - Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
  - Good.
- - So you live in Chicago now?
  - Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
- - Don't you like that?
  - No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
- - Hi, Marie.
  - Everything go alright?
- - She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
  - God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before
    I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about
    me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
  - It's a great song.
  - Thank you.
- - Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing
    up your record collection and stuff?
  - Yup.
- - You share a place with T-Bone?
  - No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff
    happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
  - I understand completely.
- - Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you
    like, not what you are like...
  - Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
  - What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except
    me.
  - Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about
    ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed
    for a couple of weeks.
- - Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn
    truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
  - Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
  - The Conformist.
  - Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
  - You haven't even seen it!
  - Nor have you!
- - Are you okay?
  - Yes.  You?
  - For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
  - I'm sure it isn't.
  - Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the
    whiskey or you want coffee?
  - Whiskey.
- - Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing
    and holding his jacket.
  - I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
  - When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know...
    talking about breakfast and stuff.
- - I'd like it if you could stay the night.
  - Oh, right.  Alright.
  - Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating
    around the bush and all that buzz.
  - I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
  - So you'll stay?
  - Yeah.
  - Good.
- - Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
  - God, you ask a lot of questions.
- - Which way are you going?
  - That way.  You?
  - That way.
  - And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
  - I'll call you.
  - Right.
- - Rob here.
  - Hey.  It's Liz.
  - What's happenin'.
  - You called this morning?
  - Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel
    like... like less of an asshole.
  - How're you holding up?
  - Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe
    it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we
    are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's
    meant to be." You know?
  - Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's
    more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I
    don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
- - What's the -- hey, Liz --
  - -- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave
    me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
- - To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out
    of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
  - It's true!
  - Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You
    borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks
    ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for
    somebody else!"
  - Well she --
- - So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they
    bury him?
  - It's a crematorium.
  - You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
  - What difference does it make?
  - Is Ray going?
  - No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit,
    you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
  - Isn't that how it is for everybody?
- - Enough, Liz.
  - Enough of what?
  - I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take
    it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well,
    I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know,
    Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me
    and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of
    a life, you know?
  - Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
  - Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you
    know?
  - If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would
    do.
- - You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
  - We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
  - Well stay for tonight, then.
- - Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
  - I should be so lucky.
- - Shit!
  - Hi.
  - Hi.
  - I thought I could give you a lift back.
  - Are you coming home?
  - Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
  - My house?
- - How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support
    the Israelis and the Palestinians.
  - It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye
    make pop records --
  - -- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
  - -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin
    Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the
    Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
  - -- Alright, alright but --
  - -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
- - Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible
    for our entire relationship!
  - Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
  - But don't you remember?
  - I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
- - You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first
    met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It
    was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
  - Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't
    have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
  - So you weren't interested in music at all?
  - Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
- - But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If
    you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
  - You really believe that?
- - Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than
    records and CDs?
  - And do you like it that way?
  - Not really.
- - Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
  - Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
- - So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
  - I think you know that.
  - Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
- - I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store
    this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
  - Good.  So.  Is it my job?
  - What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough
    a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
  - I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
  - What were the others?
  - Just the obvious stuff.
  - What's the obvious stuff?
  - I don't know.
- - I guess it's not that obvious, then.
  - No.
- - What?
  - What, what?
- - Did you say something?
  - No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
  - Rob.  Don't be childish.
  - Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
  - I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until
    I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You
    know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we
    weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like
    what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I
    want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you,
    and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further
    than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea
    what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
  - Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
- - Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll
    never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good
    time to be living here.
  - So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll
    get back together?
  - I don't know.
  - Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in
    the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's
    got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely
    going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote
    possibility.
  - I suppose so.
  - So we have a chance of getting back together again.
  - Oh, Rob, shut up.
  - Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
  - -- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
- - Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
  - Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that
    clarify the situation?
  - Yeah.  Great.
  - I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for
    a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do
    it and I can't think while you're here.
  - No problem.  If I can ask one question.
  - Fine.  One.
  - It sounds stupid.
  - Nevermind.
  - You won't like it.
  - Just ask it!
  - Is it better?
  - Is what better?  Better than what?
  - Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
  - Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
  - Of course it is.
  - You really think it would make a difference either way?
  - I don't know.
  - Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
  - Never?
  - I haven't felt like it.
  - But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
  - No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made
    love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
  - The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was
    him yet.
  - Will you please just go?
- - Hi.
  - Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm
    thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
  - I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
  - I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
  - Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then
    we'll talk.
  - We'll talk some other time.
  - Great... That's great.
- - So, how are you?
  - Have you slept with him yet?
  - I told you I slept with him.
  - No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
  - Is that why you wanted to see me?
  - I guess.
  - Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
  - I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
- - You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I
    Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed
    in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep
    Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There
    are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate
    stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all
    behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan.
    Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones
    and picks it up but says nothing.
  - You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like
    you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
- - And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The
    point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are
    you thinking?
  - Nothing.
  - We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe
    you that much.
  - Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
  - Will you call me?
  - I don't have your number.
  - Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the
    last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
  - You do, huh.
- - Hello.
  - It's me.
  - I figured it was.  Where are you?
  - I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so,
    and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running
    from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to
    hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking
    earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you,
    not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted
    more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And
    with... him.
  - I'm not -- hold on...
- - Are you still in love with me?
  - Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
  - Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
  - I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
  - I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
  - You don't ever think about other people?
  - No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about
    it.
- - I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
  - Is that the last of it?
  - Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that
    I don't even notice them.
  - Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
  - He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm
    really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
  - It was kind of funny.
- - I'm sure.
  - You still together?  Going all right?
  - I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
  - That bad, eh?
  - You know what I mean.
- - Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
  - I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much
    are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
  - You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
  - I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What
    do you call him?
  - Ray.  I hate Ian.
  - I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
- - This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages,
    and then you see the error of your ways.
  - You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But
    I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
  - You know I'm a good person.
  - Mmm hmm.
  - You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
  - Oh ho, so very infrequently.
- - Don't forget your CDs.
  - Those aren't mine.
  - Sure they are.
  - They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that
    was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I
    can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed
    by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That
    Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and
    you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram
    Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
  - Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
  - I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere,
    and I want to make sure you get it.
  - I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never
    heard of him.
  - You're being deliberately obtuse.
  - I guess I am.
  - Well, think about it.
- - Hello.
  - Hey, how ya doin'?
- - Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
  - I can't talk right now.
  - God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
- - Are you alright?
  - Pigsty.
  - Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
  - Pig died.
  - Who the fuck's Pig?
  - My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
- - I'm sorry.
  - No, no.  When are you going home?
  - In a minute.  When I get it together.
- - Me?
  - My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to
    it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks
    he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much,
    what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than
    she has to.
  - Do you want me to be there?
  - I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
- - Look, are you coming or not?
  - Yes, of course.
  - Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have
    time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
  - Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
- - Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
  - Uh... No.
- - You're soaking.
  - Mmnn.
  - You're also an idiot.
- - I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I
    wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow
    my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I
    was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
  - Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
  - What do you mean?
  - I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was
    sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
  - Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You
    get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
  - I don't want to go back.
  - What do you want to do?
  - C'mon.
- - When are you going back?
  - I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
  - What?
  - I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put
    my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
  - I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
  - It'll have to be sex, then.
- - Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
  - Hi.
  - I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
- - You know, with Ray...
  - Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
  - No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
  - Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
  - I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
- - Look, we can do other things.
  - I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried
    I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't
    that sad?
- - Laura...
  - I'm too tired not to go out with you.
- - So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are,
    what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
  - Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own,
    but not now I don't.
  - What about Ian?
  - Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes
    you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade,
    I guess, and blow it all apart.
  - Mission accomplished.
  - I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage,
    I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and
    we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
- - Let's go home.  Okay?
  - Okay.
- - C'mon.  I want to know.
  - Want to know what, exactly?
  - What it was like.
  - It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
  - Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
  - What's the difference?
  - You know the difference.
  - Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
  - Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice,
    or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
- - Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking
    you questions and it'd make me feel better.
  - Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
  - Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
  - To make you feel better.
  - Oh, great...
- - Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having
    great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word
    on the subject, okay?
  - Okay.
- - '... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.'
  - Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint
    Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
  - I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with
    the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning
    the lottery.
  - Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
  - Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to
    be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
  - But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people
    and now we're not, and...
  - How?  How were we the same people?
  - Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the
    kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts,
    and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
  - Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just
    break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out
    of patience.
  - No, but...
  - But what?
  - But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
  - You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If
    we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done
    is change jobs.
  - And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
  - I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more
    now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
  - You're tougher.
  - More confident, maybe.
  - Harder.
  - Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
  - I'm alright.
  - Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you
    get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use
    the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because
    I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're
    own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
  - You're being stupid.
  - How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going
    from legal aid to private practice?
- - All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all
    to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
  - No use.
- - Hi.
  - Hi.  What are you doing?
  - Nothing.
  - Wanna go to dinner?
  - Where?
  - At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
  - Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
  - I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship
    with him.
  - Ha.
- - You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
  - I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would
    be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether
    you still felt the same way.
- - I called Dan Koretzky because he --
  - Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
  - Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what
    he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped
    me put out a press release.
  - WHAT?
  - Just local, of course.
  - And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
  - I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I
    was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
  - You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
  - What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
  - That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
  - Barry said its done.
  - Barry?  Barry knows about this?
  - Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
- - They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't
    play for more than a half hour.
  - It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside,
    there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to
    put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records,
    sleeve them, sticker them --
  - We took care of that.
- - I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for
    me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you,
    even though I act like I don't.
  - That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
  - I know.  I don't get it.
- - Are you worried about tomorrow night?
  - Not really.
- - Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
  - I'm going to talk to you.
  - Right.
- - What are you going to talk to me about?
  - I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
  - Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
  - I mean it.
  - I know.
  - Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
  - I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you
    for The Reader, weren't you?
  - Not in love, exactly, but...
  - Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
  - Would you marry me if I was?
  - No.  Probably not.
  - Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
  - Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
  - I don't know.
  - Very persuasive.
  - Are you persuadable?
  - No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes
    for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
  - Fair enough.
  - So?
  - I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
  - About what?
  - This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
  - I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I
    will.
  - Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
  - I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
  - I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important
    thing.
  - Well, you've asked.
- - I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to
    get burned down.
  - It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
- - Can I help you?
  - Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
- - What needs sorting out?
  - Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great
    deal.
  - Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
  - We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten
    phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
  - Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
  - We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace
    here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know
    how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd
    hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want
    to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
  - Yeah.
  - Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
  - I dunno.
  - Think about it, Rob.
- - Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
  - I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink
    out of my store.
- - Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
  - We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
- - So shall we leave it at that then?
  - I dunno.
  - Think about it, Rob.
- - Laura?  Are you okay?
  - I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
- - Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
  - You look upset.
  - I'm upset, but I'm fine.
  - Maybe I should talk to him.
  - Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
  - Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
  - Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
- - '''Morning, Dick.'
  - Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
  - Good weekend?
  - Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one
    on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
  - Great.
  - I'll tape it for you.
  - No, that's okay.  Really.
  - '''Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl
    Ladd on the cover.  You didn''t see the cover though.'
  - Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
  - Well, I'll just make it for you.
  - Okay.
- - What's this?
  - The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
- - Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
  - Can I help you?
- - Are you all right?
  - Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever
    see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
  - '''Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I''ll tell him next time
    I see him.'
- - I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just
    tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
  - Fine.
  - I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much,
    really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you
    know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before
    that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
- - Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I
    mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that
    --
  - I understand, Dick.
  - Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
- - I always hated this song.
  - Yeah.
- - Let's not.
  - I want a tape.
- - Rob.
  - Liz, hold on a second --  What?
  - Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
- - Rob --!
  - -- FUCK OFF!
- - I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
  - Do it.  Do it.
- - Well we rang $900 today.
  - Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although
    our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
- - Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
  - Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
- - I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
  - You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
- - Can I do anything?
  - '"Abraham, Martin, and John." That''s a nice one.'
- - What is this.
  - It's Vince and Justin.
  - Who's that?
- - Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
  - Yeah, sure...
  - Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
  - Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
  - Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner
    Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare
    man?
  - Uh...yes, at the moment.
  - Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
- - Hey Charlie.
  - Hey Rob.
  - Why did you break up with me for Marco?
  - Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
  - Huh?
  - There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact
    Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as
    they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
  - C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
- - It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that
    I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive
    than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that
    made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend
    time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image
    started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew
    that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you
    got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know,
    glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging
    you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what
    people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think
    that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
  - Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
  - Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
- - May I help you?
  - I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
  - Uh.  That's me.
  - I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
  - Right.  Why?
  - Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again
    and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against
    the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
  - Oh.  Okay.
  - I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
  - Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have
    only been about sixteen.
- - What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old
    either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not
    much.  Just right.
  - So.  Is now a good time?
- - Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
  - Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
- - Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
  - Pardon me?
  - Your desert island top-five.
  - Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
  - Is there a difference?
  - OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an
    all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd
    go home.
  - Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
  - What do you mean, four more?
  - Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
  - Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
  - Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five
    favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
- - Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned.
    "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import,
    no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley...
    And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know,
    but...
  - Fine.  That's great.
  - Is that it?
  - Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
  - Sure, but is that it for the list?
  - That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
  - Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like
    a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
  - Nice friend.
  - Yeah.
  - What's his name?
  - Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
  - '"Music for Old People." What does that mean?'
  - Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry,
    in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
- - Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
  - Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for
    acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and
    Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's
    nowhere for them.
  - And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
  - Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a
    tape?
  - Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
  - Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
- - '"Somebody''s Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi''s Dead," Bauhaus. It''s got
    that creepy Halloween feeling.'
  - No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
- - Hey, Barry.
  - Oh, hi.
  - Where's Rob?
  - The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an
    appointment?
  - What are you talking about?
  - Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting
    out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone
    he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
- - Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
  - It's the new --
- - Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
  - No.  The Righteous Brothers.
  - Oh well.  Nevermind.
- - What?
  - Nothing.
  - No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
  - Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
  - Bullshit.
- - She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
  - Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
  - That's what I said.
  - No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the
    front of the title of the album.
  - It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But
    I could be wrong.
  - You can be and are wrong.
- - He's got one!
  - On Clark Street!
  - A couple blocks!  About six!
  - We work there!
  - You'd love it!
- - I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
  - Why?
- - Who are you going to see?
  - Nobody.
- - Anna.
  - Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
  - Anna Moss.
  - Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
- - Don't do it, Rob!
  - He's not worth it!
- - Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies
    right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
  - Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
  - -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
- - I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To
    Say I Love You." Do you have it?
  - Oh yeah.  We got it.
- - Great.  Can I have it then?
  - No, you can't.
- - Why not?
  - Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind
    of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop
    wasting our time.
  - What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
  - Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she
    in a coma?
- - It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on
    all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and
    the Bunnymen album --
  - I have all of the others.
  - Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
  - They always seemed...
  - They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always
    seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting
    here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own
    that record. That's insane.
- - Well what about the new Echo --
  - Do not get ahead of yourself.
- - That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What
    about Television?
  - I have a television.
  - NO--!
- - TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
  - IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
- - What are you doing?
  - I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
  - Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some
    old sad bastard music see if I care.
  - I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
  - But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for
    today.
  - Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
  - Don't you want to hear what's next?
  - What's next?
  - Play it.
  - Say it.
  - '"Little Latin Lupe Lu."'
- - How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
  - Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
  - Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
  - Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't
    want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation
    stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday
    morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
  - We'll do it next Monday.
  - Well what's the point in that?
- - Nice, Barry.
  - Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion
    -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day
    sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
  - You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
  - We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie
    Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight,
    and it never cost you a penny.
  - Not the point.
  - Oh, so what's the point then?
  - I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
  - '"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?'
- - Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything
    we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
  - Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have --
    and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking
    deal.
  - What did he ever do to you?
  - He offended me with his terrible taste.
  - It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
  - Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age,
    Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up
    the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right,
    Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and
    Laura into the country club?
- - Yeah.
  - But now I kind of like it.
- - I wanna date a musician...
  - I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought
    of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
  - '...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...'
- - What did you tell her about the shop for?
  - I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any
    customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
- - We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All
    three of us.
  - That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five
    each.  Fantastic, Barry!
  - We can take your car.
  - It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's
    an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on
    a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
- - What?
  - What do you mean, "what?"
  - What are you snickering about?
  - I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
  - What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
- - Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from
    The Clash.
  - Ehh.
  - '"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
    Nirvana, Nevermind.'
  - Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
  - Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead,
    from OK Computer.
  - Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped
    into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more
    obvious than that?
- - There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean
    last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I
    haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going
    to go, doesn't it?
  - -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old
    garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
  - -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would
    that mean?
- - Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil
    Dead II yet?"
  - To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura --
    oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities
    of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
  - Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen
    Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
- - I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
  - No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
  - I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this
    conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't
    seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
  - Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
  - '"-- I haven''t seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --'
  - Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
  - Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already
    gone...
- - '...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I''d get the impression that you
    wanted to see it.  Otherwise you''d say you didn''t really want to.'
  - But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
  - How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling
    you you've really gotta go see the movie.
- - Why would they care?
  - Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks
    fucking ass.
- - I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
  - Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
- - Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
  - Ha.
- - Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle,
    and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything
    at all.
  - How do you know about that?
  - Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How
    did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's
    her name?
- - Shut the fuck up, Barry.
  - Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners
    United.  United in getting some.
- - Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
  - Suck my ass.
  - Terrific.
- - Hey.
  - What the fuck is that?
  - My band.
  - What band?
  - The band that found me and asked me to join.
  - You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
  - Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
  - Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
  - I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
  - You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
  - They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
  - That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
- - Isn't it?
  - That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
  - Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You
    can stick it above the browser racks over there.
  - How many tickets can I put you down for?
  - None.  Christ!
  - You're not even coming?
  - Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible
    experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown
    Pub?  Ha!
  - So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
  - Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you
    jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
- - What's up?
  - Laura.  Her dad died.
  - Ooh.  Drag.
- - It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
  - Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's
    mom could sing it.
  - Fuck off, Barry.
  - I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
  - Because it's in The Big Chill.
  - Haven't seen it.
  - Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
  - Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
  - Not really.
- - The little skate-fuckers.
  - No way.
  - Yes way.  It's really...
- - What the fuck is that?
  - What?
  - I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're
    gonna put out a record with them.
  - So?  You even said they're good.
  - HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil
    Spector?
- - Like fuck you are.
  - Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And
    we are.
  - I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
  - We're getting that anyway.
  - What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
  - No.  We need the gig.
  - 110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me
    not to hear you play.
  - We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
  - You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there,
    people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope
    with them?
  - We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown
    thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
  - Sonic Death Monkey.
  - What do you think?  Dick likes it.
  - Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and
    to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
  - I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over
    the edge, in fact.
  - You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday
    night.
  - That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't
    take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
- - Do I know you?
  - I don't know.
- - Alison's.
  - Really.
  - Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
- - Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
  - I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
  - You gotta be kidding me.
  - That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
- - Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have
    had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
  - I beg your pardon?
  - Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her
    first boyfriend.  Me.
- - We're on the Cointreau.
  - That's right. Cointreau.
- - I won't be able to stand.
  - So lie down.
- - You're not going?
  - Just upstairs.
- - Need any help?
  - I AM house-trained.
- - I'm here.
  - I thought we'd lost you.
  - I'm coming!  Sleep well.
- - You know I do know the way home.
  - It's late.
  - Not that late.
  - Please. I want to see you home. All right?
  - All right.  No. That's nice.
  - If there's a train.
  - What do we do if there isn't?
  - We walk.
- - Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
  - Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
  - I see.
  - She's so damn... English.
  - Meaning what?
  - Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
- - I beg your pardon?
  - There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
  - We're not all frigid.
- - Oh no?
  - Oh no.
  - It's not what I heard.
  - Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
- - Oh!
  - Are you alright ?
  - I've been better.
  - Your father told me you were working here.
  - If I make it through the day.
  - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
  - No, it's good to see you.
- - Are you busy after work ?
  - Just trying to get my apartment in order.
  - Can I lend you a hand?
  - As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
  - It's a fetish of mine.
- - Steve. Thank God you came.
  - What happened to you?
- - These THINGS... they want to take me --
  - What things?
- - What's wrong?
  - Don't let them take me, Steve --
  - I won't let anybody take you.
- - What?
  - Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
  - What did I say?
  - Will you GO, damn you?
- - I'll come back later, huh?
  - Sure. Why not?
- - '''Bye.'
  - '''Bye.'
- - Who's there?
  - Daddy?
- - Kirsty?
  - I got through.
  - Where are you?
  - I found a room.
  - What did you say?
  - 'I said: I found a room.'
- - I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
  - No Dad.
  - You'd like the house.
  - YOU'D like my room.
  - Do you want me to come over?
- - Well I want you to see the house.
  - I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
- - Great.
  - Well come over, will you? See the place?
  - Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
  - What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
  - It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will
    you?
  - I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
  - I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion.
    O.K.?
  - You will keep in touch.
  - Of course. Every day.
  - O.K.
  - Take care, Dad.
  - Call me tomorrow.
  - I will. See you.
- - Big house.
  - You like?
  - Me like.
- - I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
  - Is Julia here?
  - Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
  - Surprise.
  - Kirsty.
  - O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
  - Kitchen's through on your left.
- - Are you O.K.?
  - Sure.
- - What are you drinking, love?
  - I've forgotten.
  - Steve?
- - I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
  - Never better. You sleep well.
  - Yeah.
  - I love you, honey.
  - I love you too.
- - '...maybe we should never have come back.'
  - Maybe you should give it some time.
  - I guess.
  - She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you
    liked about her.
  - You don't like her at all do you?
- - She doesn't even want to leave the house.
  - Really?
  - It's like she's waiting for something.
  - What?
  - I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
- - Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
  - Sure.
  - Maybe all she needs is some company.
- - I have to talk to you.
  - Of course.
- - It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
  - No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And
    he's --
  - Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
  - Finished?
  - He's gone.
  - Gone?
- - Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
  - I don't believe it.
  - I'm afraid it's true.
  - I want to see.
  - No you don't.
  - Yes!
  - Show her.
- - Get the fuck out of here.
  - What's the problem?
  - PLEASE. You're in danger.
  - No. It's all over.
  - It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
- - Where are you going?
  - I have to get out.
- - You're awake. Good girl.
  - What happened to me?
  - I'll get the doctor.
  - Wait a moment --
- - Who brought me in here?
  - I won't be a moment.
- - What a pretty tune.
  - My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
  - I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying
    your father; he'll answer eventually.
  - I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
  - Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what
    happened, instead of a policeman --
- - You wouldn't believe me.
  - Try me.
- - Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
  - Steve.
- - Not much fun, is it?
  - What?
  - Drinking alone.
  - Not much.
  - I wonder, maybe...
- - What are you drinking?
  - Just soda.
  - Plain soda?
  - Please.
  - I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to
    keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power.
    Got a busy afternoon?
  - That depends.
  - Oh?
- - You know it's not often I... you know...
  - There's a first time for everything.
  - I suppose that's right.
  - You want something to drink?
  - I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known
    you for years.
- - Well, isn't it?
  - I... suppose so, yes.
  - So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking
    mind ?
  - No. No. Let's go upstairs.
  - That's more like it.
- - Is this your place ?
  - Do you care ?
  - No, not much.
  - Let's keep it that way, shall we?
  - No personal details?
  - That's right.
- - This isn't the bedroom.
  - No.
- - What's going on?
  - We don't need a bed, do we?
- - I suppose not.
  - I prefer the floor.
- - First time for everything.
  - That's right.
- - Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
  - Yeah, why don't I?
- - Why don't you do the same?
  - Maybe I will.
- - You know, you're very beautiful.
  - Am I?
  - You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
- - Oh Christ.
  - What's wrong?
  - Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
- - It's ONE of these.
  - We're going to freeze to death.
  - O.K. O.K.
- - Maybe somebody changed the lock.
  - Like who?
  - Just a thought --
  - Ah!
- - It smells damp.
  - It's just been empty a while.
- - How long since you were here?
  - The best part of ten years.
- - Why didn't he want to sell it?
  - I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
- - Not exactly modern.
  - We'll sell it. Sell everything.
  - I thought half of it was your brother's?
  - He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
- - You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll
    love it.
  - You mean we're moving in?
- - You're still blaming me.
  - No. I'm not.
  - You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
- - All right.
  - So what's the argument?
  - No argument.
  - Oh Christ. Julia...
- - Larry!
  - I hear you.
- - Where are you?
  - In here.
- - He's here?
  - He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
- - Well?
  - Why not?
  - We'll move in Sunday.
- - How are you doing through there?
  - It looks like a bomb's dropped.
- - What have you done?
  - I cut myself.
- - Is it deep?
  - I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
  - You're NOT going to faint.
  - Shit.
  - Let me see.
- - It's probably going to need stitches.
  - I'm going to throw up.
  - No, you're not.
- - Take it slowly.
  - So damn stupid.
  - You're done worse.
  - I'll be scarred for life.
  - No you won't.
- - Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
  - Larry....
  - Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
- - Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
  - Are you O.K.?
- - Julia?
  - I'm here.
  - Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
- - Are you all right?
  - Just feeling a bit sick.
  - Oh, babe...
- - I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
  - Can I get you anything?
  - Maybe a brandy.
  - Sure.
  - I'll be down in a minute
  - O.K.
- - Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
  - O.K.
- - Who was it?
  - Kirsty.
- - Is this upsetting you?
  - I've seen worse.
- - Are you all right?
  - Fine.
  - Only I'll turn it off --
- - -- I'll go see.
  - No. I'll do it.
- - Larry...
  - What's wrong with you?
- - Oh baby.
  - Don't go upstairs.
  - Come with me then.
- - Huh?
  - Please...
  - What's wrong with you?
  - Please. I can't bear it...
- - What's wrong?
  - I don't know where to begin...
  - What are you talking about?
  - It's better you see for yourself --
- - Dead.
  - 'He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --'
- - Kirsty.
  - Hi. I got soaked.
  - There's a towel in the bathroom.
  - Which is where?
  - Just to your left.
- - What happened?
  - Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
  - Sure.
  - The keys are in the kitchen.
- - Kirsty? It's very late.
  - Where's Daddy?
  - What's the problem?
  - I have to see my father.
  - Of course. There's no need to shout.
- - You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
  - I was here this afternoon.
  - This afternoon.
  - I saw everything.
  - I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
- - No, damn you --
  - Oh my God.
- - You're Julia, right?
  - That's right. Who are you?
  - I'm brother Frank.
  - Oh.
  - I came for the wedding.
- - There is going to BE a wedding?
  - Oh.  Oh yes.
  - Well can I come in or not?
  - I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
- - Well?
  - I don't want to see the dress.
  - But you said --
  - I don't want to see the dress.
- - What about Larry --
  - Forget him.
- - Wedded bliss?
  - I'm very happy.
  - Sure you are.
- - Julia.
  - Oh my God.
  - Don't look at me.
  - Who are you?
  - 'I said: don''t look.'
- - Help me.
  - Tell me who you are.
  - Frank.
- - No. God no.
  - Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
  - What happened to you?
  - His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
  - Back from where?
  - Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
- - '...somebody...'
  - Ssh!
- - You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
  - What do you want me to do.
  - The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
- - I'm hurting
  - Hurting.
  - My nerves... are beginning to work again.
  - Good.
  - One more. Maybe two --
- - -- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
  - Who?
  - The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them.
    I have to get away from here.
- - Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
  - Keep your voice down.
- - Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
  - You're hurting.
  - You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together,
    the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
- - Well?
  - Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will
    you bring me some?
  - Later.
  - What?
  - I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
  - Not know.
  - Tell me, damn you.
- - A long time.
  - You promised me an explanation.
- - This is what began it.
  - A box?
  - It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
  - Let me see.
  - Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
  - What kind of doors?
  - To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised
    when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
  - Hell...
  - I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left
    to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
  - And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
  - Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
  - Who did?
  - The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still
    here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting
    to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
  - You're still afraid.
  - You would be. They tore me apart.
  - So you were cheated.
  - No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
- - They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the
    walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
  - And the blood let you out?
  - It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to
    live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
  - Yes. They'll never find us.
- - You can't love him.
  - I don't.
  - So where's the harm?
  - I said no.
  - Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
- - She'll tell them everything...
  - I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
  - That's probably her now. Or the police.
  - Maybe.
  - Don't you care?
  - There's very little I can do about it.
  - Maybe we should just leave --
  - Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
  - Well we can't just stay here --
  - I need a skin. Then we leave --
- - Julia!
  - Kirsty?
- - Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
  - No.
  - You remember.
  - No.
  - Come to Daddy.
- - Don't touch me. Or so help me --
  - What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
- - I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
  - This isn't happening.
  - I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.
    But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that
    makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
- - No.
  - One last time. Give me the box.
  - You want it?
- - Come to Daddy.
  - This isn't happening.
  - Some things have to be endured...
- - Oh my God.
  - Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
- - You bastard --
  - Poor baby.
  - Bastard.
  - Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
  - Frank --
  - That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
- - Please. Get back into bed.
  - I have to speak to my father.
  - That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
  - It's important.
  - You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
- - Please listen to me --
  - First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who
    did this to you?
- - You were holding onto it like grim death.
  - I don't remember.
  - Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
  - Oh Christ.
  - We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
- - The box... you opened it. We came.
  - It's just a puzzle box.
  - It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
  - Who are you?
  - Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels
    to others.
  - Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
- - This isn't for real.
  - You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
- - He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
  - No!
- - Let me alone, will you?
  - No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
- - No time for argument.
  - You did this before, right?
  - Many times.
  - To a man called Frank Cotton?
- - Nobody escapes us.
  - HE did. I've seen him.
- - Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
  - I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
- - We want the man who did this --
  - No. That wasn't the deal.
- - Just in time.
  - Stay the fuck away from me.
- - We've got such sights to show you --
  - You can keep them.
- - Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
  - It'll go in.
- - Alright, let's give it another try.
  - Do you really need this bed, lady?
- - That your daughter?
  - Uh-huh.
  - Got her mother's looks.
  - Her mother's dead.
- - Oh.
  - Julia's my second wife.
  - Lucky man.
  - Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
- - It's my lucky day.
  - Hi.
  - Want to buy a bed?
  - Not much.
- - What's happening?
  - We're leaving.
  - Where's my father?
- - Will you sign for the bed?
  - Sure.
- - Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
  - Look, do you want the bed in or not?
  - Just take it slowly.
  - Oh, sod you.
- - Christ!
  - What's the problem?
  - My fucking hand!
- - You fucking ass-holes.
  - Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking
    problem!
- - Hello, I'm --
  - -- Late. Five minutes late.
  - Yes, I --
  - -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
  - Pardon?
  - Two steps back, please.
- - Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
  - 60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
  - 'It''s still impressive by my standards: My name''s John.'
- - Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no
    security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
  - Doesn't sounds like him.
  - Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
- - I admire him. He's a force of nature.
  - He's just pushy.
  - No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
  - Cocky.
  - Strong.
  - A brute.
  - My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their
    defects.
- - He -- loves you.
  - I know.
  - What about you?
  - Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time
    I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now,
    I feel he's here --
- - It's freezing, isn't it?
  - Coffee's warming me up.
- - But it's not true, is it?
  - What -- ?
  - That you feel that way about me.
  - You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
- - Hit me.
  - What?
- - You better have that looked at.
  - Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
- - We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at
    me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
  - No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know
    what? I'm learning to control it.
- - Goodnight, then.
  - Goodnight.
- - Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to
    hear.
  - Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
  - Out? Out out?
  - For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
  - You're going alone?
  - No. Myers is taking me.
- - It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
  - Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
- - Hi.
  - I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
- - But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel
    out of place -- out there --
  - Red, I --
  - 'Listen. I''m not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that''s
    good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can''t.  I
    can promise you only two things... One: I''ll always look this good. Two: I won''t
    give up on you. Ever.'
  - I like that...
  - Good.
- - Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
  - Marco...
  - '...Polo.'
- - You're kidding --
  - Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
- - Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
  - Father's back?  Still angry?
- - Whatcha looking at, John??
  - Oh-n-no -- I --
- - Helping you -- I just --
  - No one ever helps me. It's my job.
- - Myers??? How's your arm?
  - My arm is fine. Where are you??
- - I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
  - Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
  - 'No, no, no, it''s fine: I do my job, I take a break.'
  - No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
  - Myers?
  - Yes?
  - Goodbye.
- - What took you so long?
  - C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
  - What are you, a Boy Scout?
  - No. I never was.
  - Could've fooled me. Go away.
- - You want me to hold him down?
  - That's right, Stud, hold me down.
- - Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
  - Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head
    --
- - Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
  - Professor, that girl you were talking about --
  - 'Hey. You: think twice --'
  - I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
  - What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area
    of expertise?
- - What was that??
  - Hostage negotiations.
- - Where do you --
  - Shh! Just a second.
- - Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
  - '"Need" is a good, solid word.'
  - Nah, sounds too "needy."
  - Start in, you got nachos coming.
- - Hey, your chili's getting cold --
  - Not hungry.
- - Anything else you --
  - Not from you.
  - Well good n-
  - Good night.
- - Are you sure about this?
  - 'On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she''ll take care of you, Myers. She''s
    a tough one.'
- - Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
  - Alone?
  - How big can it be?
- - But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive
    the night. You're reckless.
  - I knew those men better than you did --
  - Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
- - No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
  - That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
  - What are you trying to say?
  - 'In the end, after you''ve killed and captured every freak out there -- there''s
    still one left: you.'
  - I wish I could be more gracious but --
- - '"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you
    get four. You kill four, you''re in trouble. We have to nail ''em all at once.
    And the eggs.'
  - 'When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.'
- - We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety
    pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
  - Those things never work. Never.
  - Each of us gets a belt.
  - I won't take 'em. They never work.
- - We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
  - Don't move. We --
  - -- should go back. Now!
  - No. Don't --
  - I'm in charge. We go back!
- - You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
  - You call that thing a cigar??
  - Yup.
  - You never, ever light a cigar that way.
- - Thank you.
  - My job.
- - That voice --
  - I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I
    alone know your true calling, your true name.
  - Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
- - She's dead.
  - Noooo! Noooo!!!
- - 'Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And
    crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the
    key.'
  - Anung-un-Rama...
- - You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside
    you.
  - I can live with that.
- - They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
  - Grounded? Who's grounded?
  - Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
- - He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his
    keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
  - Who?!
- - Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
  - 'Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn''t age like we do -- think dog
    years: He''s barely out of his teens.'
- - Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
  - His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
  - His what??!!
- - Sir, may I go first??
  - Not so fast. He barely knows him --
- - Who's the squirt?
  - Agent Myers is your new liaison.
  - Got tired of me?
  - Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
- - I don't want him.
  - Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
- - Well, you did break out --
  - I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
  - It is. You got yourself on TV again.
  - '"Myers", huh? You have a first name??'
  - Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
- - Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
  - We're on the move.
  - C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
- - At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
  - Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
- - C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
  - This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
- - They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
  - Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
  - The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
- - How does he know so much about me?
  - Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite
    a bit around here.
  - Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
  - As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
  - On the desk, yes. In Latin.
  - Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
  - '"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."'
  - '"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump
    in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.'
- - 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
  - 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
  - Did he, now?
- - I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
  - You're doing fine.
- - And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's
    often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
  - Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
- - A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
  - Who wards off demons.
  - Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was
    hollow --
  - Reliquary --
  - A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the
    List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
- - Son. About Rasputin --
  - Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
  - Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
  - How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
  - I worry about you.
  - Me?? C'mon --
  - Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
  - Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
- - Don't look! Turn around.
  - Is it bad?
- - How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
  - That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
- - It's her choice --  She's human --
  - Oh, as opposed to -- ?
- - Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies,
    Trevor.
  - I thought you liked being on TV.
  - 'I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!'
  - Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
  - Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
  - He's just going through a phase --
- - These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're
    up for review. You and your petting zoo.
  - I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
- - It's almost over!!
  - No. It's not.
- - Do you believe in hell?
  - There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From
    there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
  - Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
  - Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
  - C'mon -- Rasputin??
  - Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was
    poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
  - That makes him more than a hundred --
- - What the hell was that? An ape?
  - No. It was red. Bright red.
- - It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
  - I think that is its hand.
- - This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
  - Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
- - Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
  - What is it?
  - In private, if you don't mind...
- - You are a Catholic??
  - Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
- - Here. You'll need one of these.
  - I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
  - Three days too late for that one, "professor."
- - 'You''re wasting our time: There''s nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.'
  - Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley
    Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
  - What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal
    --
  - '"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.'
  - Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
  - I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
  - Oh, I'll bet you have.
- - The freak in the gas mask --
  - Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult
    Society.
- - If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
  - Air and sea backup. What's closest?
- - Cordon off the area. Something came through.
  - From where??!!
- - That's all for you, Sammy.
  - Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
- - hound of resurrection --
  - See? I don't like that --
  - -- Hound of resurrection?
- - harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
  - Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
  - It doesn't say --
- - Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
  - Story of my life.
  - I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be
    outside --
  - You mean, outside... with her.
- - Don't get psychic with me.
  - Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
- - How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
  - Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
  - We don't take hints.
- - 'Would''ya look at this babies? Made ''em myself. Holy water, silver shavings,
    white oak: the works.'
  - Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
- - Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus
    belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
  - Red, I found something --
- - Nah -- he's taken care of.
  - 'No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal
    --'
- - You were burned by some organic acid.
  - I'm lucky that way.
- - Red. How long was it latched onto you?
  - I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
- - Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
  - Didn't even buy me a drink.
- - Remind me why I keep doing this.
  - Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
  - Oh, right --
- - I need to touch it to "see"...
  - See what??
  - The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
  - Is he serious??
  - Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
- - They were over here, Professor.
  - Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
- - Where am I?
  - You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't
    feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your
    boyfriend...?
  - Steve...
  - Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
- - What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
  - What are you talking about? Who are you?
  - Oh, excuse me...
- - I thought Steve had talked to you?
  - Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value.
    No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
- - He talked about Demons, huh?
  - Yeah.
- - What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
  - The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
- - Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
  - I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they
    came.
  - Who?
  - The Cenobites.
- - But I didn't open it! I didn't!
  - Then why are you here?
  - I've come for my father!
- - But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
  - And what about you?
- - Wait!
  - No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at
    bargaining.
  - No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
  - Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in
    Hell.
- - What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
  - No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were
    wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
  - Nonsense, I...
  - It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember
    all your confusions. Think!
- - I... remember.
  - You were ALL human!
- - I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
  - What are you talking...
  - I've got to finish it.
  - Finish what?
- - I'm scared.
  - No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
- - Well... G'bye.
  - It's been Hell.
- - So... You're Kirsty, huh?
  - You a doctor, too?
- - Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
  - What's the matter with her?
  - Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
  - God, that's terrible.
  - Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says
    it's helping to bring her out.
- - I... I had a visitor.
  - What?
  - Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to
    save him and I don't know how to help!
  - Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
  - I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said
    He'd listen. He promised.
- - Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
  - If anyone can help, HE can.
- - No bad dreams.
  - So you slept O.K.?
- - Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
  - Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
- - And you're sure it was a woman?
  - God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude,
    you know.
- - Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
  - Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
- - The box. I need the box.
  - The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
- - What?
  - The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
  - What do you mean?
  - The boxes! I TOLD you.
  - You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
  - Yeah. The things you were talking about.
- - Get out of the way.
  - Are you crazy?
  - I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
  - WHY?
  - Because I'm going to get my father!
- - O.K. Let's go.
  - Kyle, you don't have...
  - I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking
    idiot. O.K.?
- - Yes... Yes. You look...
  - Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
  - No. You look...
- - It's a beautiful dress...
  - I know.
- - She's done it.
  - She certainly has.
  - It's coming.
  - It certainly is.
- - I want to go back!
  - Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward
    the only way to go.
- - I knew you'd come back.
  - I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
- - Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
  - Yes!
  - Shit. Bull. Shit.
- - See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
  - No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
  - '''Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We''re the same. Brothers. Equal
    and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.'
- - He... he loved me.
  - Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
- - Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
  - I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
- - Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
  - Julia.
  - Frank.
  - I knew you'd come.
  - You knew?
  - Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
  - Oh, I do. I do.
- - Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
  - Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
- - It's different for us.
  - We've always been here.
  - We have no more surprises.
- - Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
  - No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
  - Time to play.
- - Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
  - Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
  - Yes.
  - Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
- - Were you also the one who painted the statues?
  - Oh, yes. How did you like that?
  - Well, I didn't.
  - Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
  - But wait...
- - Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
  - Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
  - Well, it's a tricky turn.
  - Eh, yes, ma'm.
  - Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
  - Oh yes. That's fine.
  - Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
- - Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
  - Thank you, Uncle.
  - Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves
    your respect.
  - Yes, sir.
  - Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good
    and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner
    over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why
    we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
- - Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright
    condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about
    by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen.
    That's common knowledge.
  - During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
  - Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying.
    War is not all black.
  - War is not all black.
- - And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians
    in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a
    national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought
    were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence
    where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the
    kind of war this whole country can support.
  - Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
- - They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!
    "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said,
    and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but
    they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat
    red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat!
    Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of
    the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I
    asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
  - Jeez! That's a great story,
  - Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
  - You think so, sir?
  - Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud
    of.
  - I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
  - It's the greatest excitement in the world.
  - To pit your own life against another.
  - That's right.
  - To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
  - The moment of truth.
  - Another man's life in your sights.
  - Yes.
  - ZAT!
- - Will they really teach me to shoot?
  - Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
  - And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
  - Oh sure.
  - How about hand-to-hand combat?
  - Yes.
  - To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
  - Eh?
  - How about to slit his throat?
  - Well, I don't...
  - I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
  - Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
  - Sir, how about souvenirs?
  - Souvenirs?
  - Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
  - Harold!
  - What's the chance of getting one of these?
- - Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
  - Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
- - Parasite!
  - Harold!
  - Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
- - Harold, calm down! This is...
  - She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
- - Stay where you are, Harold .
  - She took my head.
- - Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
  - An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
  - And why is that?
  - Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning
    stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
  - Just give me a rough estimate.
  - Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
  - Fifteen.
  - A rough estimate.
  - And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
  - I wouldn't say "benefit."
  - No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
- - I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
  - Does that worry you?
  - Yes. It does.
  - Why?
  - I put a lot of effort into these things.
  - Ah, yes.
  - And a lot of time.
  - I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
  - No.
  - What about the draft?
  - My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
  - Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
  - You mean when I'm not working on a...
  - Yes. What kind of things do you do?
- - I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
  - I don't know.
  - Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
  - No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
  - What else do you like?
- - That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to
    be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions
    seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges
    and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And
    of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem
    and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do
    for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the
    others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
  - I go to funerals.
- - Harold?
  - Huh?
  - You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
  - No.
  - None at all?
  - Well, maybe one.
  - Would you care to talk about this friend?
  - No.
  - Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
  - No.
  - I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
  - Yes.
  - You liked your teachers?
  - Yes.
  - Your classmates?
  - Yes.
  - Your studies?
  - Yes.
  - Then why did you leave?
  - I burnt down the Chemistry building.
- - We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true
    and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this
    reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only
    hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
  - Yes.
  - Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with
    some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
- - I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
  - No.  I'd have liked to.
  - Why?
  - I'd have liked to talk to him.
  - What would you say?
  - I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
  - What kind of stuff?
- - How do you do?
  - Can't complain.
- - Would you like a cigarette?
  - No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
- - Is Sunshine your real name?
  - Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps
    you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument.
    That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the
    need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is
    my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
- - Do you play?
  - No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
  - Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers.
    As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
- - Oh, is this your father?
  - No. My uncle.
  - Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make
    men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine
    - with a French accent.
- - This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
  - Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
  - An ancient Japanese ceremony.
  - Like a tea ceremony?
  - No. Like this.
- - Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once
    in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating
    nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber
    water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent"
    to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you
    feel well?
  - I have a sore throat.
  - Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible
    you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed
    to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
- - Mother.
  - Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
  - Mother.
  - Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
  - Mother. I'm going to get married.
  - Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
  - I'm getting married.
  - To whom?
  - To a girl. Here.
- - I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
  - What?
  - A sunflower?
- - Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where
    did you meet her?
  - At a funeral.
  - Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law!
    Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
  - I don't care what people say.
  - You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen
    to me...
- - I'm going to marry the woman I love.
  - Harold!
- - This is insane.
  - Perhaps it is.
- - Eh, no. Thank you.
  - You're welcome.  Did you know him?
  - Eh, no.
  - Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good
    time to move on, don't you think?
  - I don't know.
  - I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking
    time and you may as well look over the horizon.
- - It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
  - Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
  - Oh, of course. What is your name?
  - Harold Chasen.
  - How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
  - Nice to meet you.
  - Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
- - Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
  - No, thank you. I have my car.
  - Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
- - Do you dance?
  - What?
  - Do you sing and dance?
  - Eh, no.
  - No.  I thought not.
- - Yes.
  - Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials
    and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great
    circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
  - Yes.
  - Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
  - But this is my car.
  - Your hearse?
  - Yearse!
  - Oh.
- - Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many
    as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of
    variation.
  - And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
  - Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience,
    like this one. I liked it.
  - Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
  - What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We
    come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership"
    a little absurd?
  - Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
  - Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things,
    then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy --
    Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that
    in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
- - It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
  - It's very interesting.
  - Oh, look! The birds.
- - She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on
    the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
  - Thank you, but I really have to go.
  - But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
  - No.
  - Well then.
- - Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
  - Oh, at the dentist's?
  - Sort of.
  - Well, then, you must come back and visit.
  - All right.
  - My door is always open.
  - All right.
  - Promise?
- - Harold?
  - Maude???!
- - How about some ginger pie?
  - Eh, fine.
  - I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
  - Oh, it's fine. Fine.
  - She seemed yare to me.
- - Do you often model for Glaucus?
  - Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus
    occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do
    you disapprove?
  - Me! No. Of course not.
  - Really. Do you think it's wrong?
  - No.
  - Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This
    is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction
    of Leda and the Swan.
- - A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg
    Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
  - Yes. Very much.
  - It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
- - Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you
    smell?
  - Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
  - It goes on and on.
  - That's really great.
- - What do you think?
  - Oh. Eh, I like it.
  - No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it,
    really reach out and feel. You try it.
- - Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
  - Certainly a new experience for me.
  - Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it
    out. It doesn't last forever.
- - You look as if you could.
  - Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
  - You don't look eighty.
  - That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet
    the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving
    out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten
    the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
  - That's a nice teapot.
  - Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty
    pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so.
    Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
- - Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
  - What do you mean?
- - I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u>
    and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
  - I don't know. Just one of those.
- - Why do you say that?
  - Because they are all the same.
  - Oooh, but they are not. Look.
- - Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
  - Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse
    or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of
    course, the age has its advantages.
- - The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
  - Well...
- - What happened?
  - Look.
  - What?
  - Over there by the courthouse.
  - What is it?
  - That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
- - Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it,
    but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold,
    we've got to do something about this life.
  - But what?
  - We'll transplant it. To the forest.
  - But we can't just dig it up!
  - Why not?
  - But this is public property.
  - Exactly.
- - Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
  - Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
  - Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
- - Oh, my. We're too late.
  - Is he all right?
  - He's fallen asleep, as usual.
- - We'll come back in the morning.
  - What is that he's working on?
  - An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is
    his unfulfilled dream.
  - It is kind of rough.
  - He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to
    man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
  - Look, the ice is melting.
  - Yes.
- - A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
  - Well, I really don't drink...
  - Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
- - Thank you.
  - Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is
    not really a human trait.
  - Thank you.
- - What's that?
  - My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to
    America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings
    - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long
    time ago.
  - What were you fighting for?
  - Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't
    regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I
    do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna,
    to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing
    uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later,
    Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University.
    And in the government.
- - No.
  - No more revolts.
  - Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting
    for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
  - Well, I don't...
  - Oh come on. I'll teach you.
- - Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
  - But I don't play anything.
  - Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why,
    it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
- - Okay?
  - Superb.
- - I think he's following us.
  - Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
- - He's stopped.
  - The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
- - There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth.
    "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
  - I don't know.
  - I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall
    to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
- - Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
  - Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
- - I <u>think</u> I see it.
  - Yes. It's almost there.
- - The ice is melting.
  - Yes.
  - Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
  - Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
- - I like Glaucus.
  - Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
  - Well, I really don't smoke.
  - It's all right.  It's organic.
  - I'm sure picking up on vices.
  - Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much
    life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good
    things happen."
  - Did Confucius say that?
  - Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
  - You are the wisest person I know.
  - Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long
    ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used
    to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a
    maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most
    instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back
    at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this
    too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you
    can't help but live life fully.
  - Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
  - What was that?
  - Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with
    a popgun and a pellet of blood.
  - How ingenious! Tell me about them.
  - Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience...
    You really want to hear about this?
  - Of course.
  - Okay.
- - Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really.
    They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench.
    The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take
    a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an
    "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll
    have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
  - I like you, Maude.
  - I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
- - Look at that sky.  It's so big.
  - It's so blue.
  - And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
  - Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't
    see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
  - Maude, do you pray?
  - Pray? No.  I communicate.
  - With God?
  - With Life.
- - This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
  - Well, why don't you?
  - No. I'd feel stupid.
  - Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't
    let the world judge you too much.
- - Want to join me in some cartwheels?
  - No. I feel more like - yodeling.
  - Yodeling?
- - It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's
    getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he
    can."
  - Where's that?
  - From the guys who got the matches, of course.
  - Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
- - Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
  - Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
  - Oh.
  - I've never met her. My mother set it up.
  - Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and
    it has been my experience that kindness...
- - Maude, I must speak to you.
  - What is it, Harold?
  - They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
  - But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
  - But they have.
  - Well, don't go.
- - But they'll put me in jail.
  - Really. Just put it there, Harold.
- - They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's
    what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with
    the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with
    no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become
    one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore
    and should be scrupulously avoided.
  - Maude, do you think you can help me?
  - What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
- - Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir,
    I thought that you at least...
  - Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
- - Don't you advance on me.
  - '... of you. You''ll all end up like this.'
- - Just like this.
  - Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
  - She took my head.
- - That wasn't very scary.
  - No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
  - Oh, you weren't scared.
  - Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
  - Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
- - How about some candy floss?
  - Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
- - You sure have a way with people.
  - Well, they're my species.
- - Look at the stars.
  - Yes. They're old friends.
  - Do you think there is any life up there?
  - I don't know. Perhaps.
  - Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
  - We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars
    and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them,
    too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing
    along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and
    the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are
    alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
  - You should have been a poet.
  - Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut
    able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want
    to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be
    if like them I -
- - '- end where I began.'
  - Maude.
  - Yes.
  - Here.
- - Why are there no photographs in these frames?
  - I took them out.
  - Why?
  - They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew
    these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have
    left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My
    memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by
    Kodak with silver nitrate.
  - I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
- - It looks like you. Thanks.
  - Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
  - You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
- - I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing...
    except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
  - You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything,
    you could always be happy.
  - Oh, Harold. You are so young.
- - Supper for two.
  - Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
  - It's all right. It's organic.
  - Oh, Harold.
  - For you.
- - '... which I hope will make you very happy.'
  - Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
  - Farewell?
  - Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
  - But you're not going anywhere, are you?
  - Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
- - Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
  - Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
  - But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about
    death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
  - But why now?
  - I thought eighty was a good round number.
- - I feel giddy.
  - But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that
    to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
  - Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
  - It's true. I can't live without you.
  - '"And this too shall pass away."'
  - Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand!
    I love you. I love you!
  - Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
- - Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
  - Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
- - Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
  - Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to
    spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
- - What do you want?
  - I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
- - Sorry I'm late.
  - A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little
    one.  Tell me, what do you see?
  - A block of ice.
  - Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
  - What do you see?
  - I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate
    woman.
- - Here's your shovel.
  - What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of
    the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
- - This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been
    tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
  - What kind of a car is it?
- - Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
  - Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
  - Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
- - And what do you do, my dear?
  - I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
  - How interesting.
  - Not very.
  - Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
  - I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most
    of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
- - Edith was just telling me about her job.
  - I'm a file clerk.
  - Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
  - Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of
    the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
  - She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
  - Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was
    very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
- - Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license,
    please?
  - Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
  - Yes.
  - Oh, I don't have one.
  - Come again.
  - I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
  - How long have you been driving?
  - About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner
    but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
  - Could I see your registration?
  - I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you
    look, Harold?
  - Isn't this your vehicle?
  - No, no. I just took it.
  - Took it?
  - Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
  - Your tree.
  - Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting
    it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into
    soil, as soon as possible.
  - Lady, let me get this straight.
  - All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
- - Okay, lady. Out.
  - Hello.
- - Haven't we met before?
  - None of that, lady.
  - Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
  - Out!
- - But there is a family resemblance.
  - You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you
    down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without
    a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the
    tree?
  - We planted it.
  - Is this your shovel?
  - No.
  - Possession of a stolen shovel.
  - Officer, I can explain.
  - Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal
    code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
  - Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the
    curse of a government job.
  - Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
  - Check.
  - And that truck - is it registered in your name?
  - Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
  - Then whose name is it registered in?
  - Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
  - Where are the papers?
  - I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
  - Wait here.
  - Because if you are...
  - Lady! Be quiet.
- - Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
  - How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
- - You are at the University, Candy?
  - Yes, I am.
  - And what are you studying?
  - Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
  - Eh, Poli Sci?
  - Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
- - He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's
    such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home
    ec.
  - Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer
    club?
- - I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
  - Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up,
    too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well,
    Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole
    family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter
    Cronkite.
- - You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
  - You working in San Diego now?
  - I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
  - '''Was.'' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn''t say
    that. Anyway, I hear he''s back in Frisco now.'
  - Was he with a girl?
  - No.
  - Thanks.
- - Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
  - You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that
    car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy
    Queen? Went busted too.
  - At least I improved myself. What's up?
- - I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
  - No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
  - Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
  - Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't
    touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
- - You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
  - My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
  - Granville's looking for you anyway.
  - Who's that?
  - The guy who bought you that ring.
  - Well, he can just fuck himself.
- - You can fuck off, too.
  - You're taking a big chance.
  - I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
  - Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
- - Jake'll take care of me.
  - Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds
    his daughter he'll care about you?
- - Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
  - Oh.
- - I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll
    finish me.
  - I'm worried about Jake.
  - I'm off that case. He fired me.
  - He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into
    some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
  - I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway
    cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld
    for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing
    her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure
    on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people
    for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw
    deal.
- - I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
  - I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty
    a week, plus travel expenses.
  - Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
- - Maybe. Maybe not.
  - I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
  - Huh?
  - You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once.
    Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and
    staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched
    that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
  - To his own daughter?
  - To anybody.
- - You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
  - He asked me. You going with anybody?
  - I don't know.
  - You ever play Chicken?
  - What's that?
  - You never heard of that?
  - Com'on, tell me.
  - Well, a boy goes like this, see.
- - What does that do?
  - Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
- - I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking
    everybody. Nobody knows anything.
  - Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
  - I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen,
    but I suppose you've never seen her?
  - Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
  - Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
- - Hold it, mister.
  - What do you think of that? Or this?
- - No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
  - My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
  - Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the
    man to come to.
  - Film making can be pretty expensive...
- - I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
  - Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
  - Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money.
    I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher
    Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business
    manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
  - What exactly do you have in mind?
  - I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process
    of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
  - In other words, you want to get laid?
  - Not exactly...
  - It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you
    get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy.
    You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your
    life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
  - It's an investment.
  - If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around
    and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
  - I thought you were a businessman.
  - Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars
    possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films
    I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand
    dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That
    way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll
    take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
  - Jake.
  - '...I''d just start my own business. That''s what I did. Get into kid porn. That''s
    big now. Why don''t you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want
    to invest, I''ll ask around.'
  - Sounds all right.
  - Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
- - Fifty cents admission.
  - What?
  - It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
- - Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
  - What we got is just these here.  What you see.
  - It's a short film.
  - They're all about the same. You want something?
- - This is from the movie I was talking about.
  - I don't know what you're talking about.
  - I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
  - That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
  - I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
  - I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see
    the cops.
  - But I...
  - I don't know nothing, man.
- - You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
  - No.
- - Here. Take your fifty cents back.
  - That's all right.
  - No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
- - I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
  - Yeah.
  - Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other
    affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
  - No.
  - What you got in mind?
  - I want to meet Ratan.
  - What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
  - I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
  - You're talking about real excitement?
  - Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of
    a girl being, ah you know...
  - Who told you about this?
  - Rucker.
  - I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course.
    Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
  - Is this with a girl named Kristen?
  - Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
  - Well...
  - Take it or leave it.
  - Okay.
  - Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
  - Good.
- - What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
  - I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with
    you.
  - I don't know what you're talking about.
- - You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
  - You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
- - Where's Ratan?
  - Who?
- - That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
  - Ratan!
- - Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
  - Let's go.
- - Hey man.
  - We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
  - I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
  - That's not true, Mr...?
  - Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
  - That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking
    for.
- - Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's
    true. But good stuff.
  - That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
- - Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
  - It was called 'Slave of Love.'
  - God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five
    bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
  - I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought
    she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
- - Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do
    anything you want to me.
  - Where is she? Where is the girl?
  - She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
  - Where does he hang out?
  - I don't know.
  - Where!
  - Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
- - You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
  - No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
  - Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll
    be all alone.
- - What is it, Jake?
  - Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
- - What happened?
  - They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm
    and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find
    her.
- - Is Marsha there?
  - Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some
    pictures.
  - I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
- - How's your business, Jake?
  - Pretty good.
  - You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains
    she doesn't see you anymore.
- - Jake?
  - How did you find me?
  - I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your
    office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's
    happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick.
    We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
- - Wes, do me a favor.
  - What?
  - Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
- - Just do what I say. Don't ask.
  - What is going on?
  - I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
  - What plan?
  - You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
  - What will I tell the others? They care about you.
  - Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell
    them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
- - Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive
    reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but
    if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and
    that's where I come in.
  - Well, what do they know?
  - Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
  - So then, Mr. Mast...
  - Andy.
  - '...What do you have to offer?'
  - Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me,
    was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes,
    maybe?
- - No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was
    an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure
    thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
  - If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
  - Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go
    back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
  - Who's paying you?
  - You are.
  - That's right.
  - As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's
    not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back
    home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody
    out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week.
    It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
  - And better?
  - I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth
    into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
- - Hello?
  - Mr. Van Dorn?
  - Mast?
  - Yeah.
  - Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
  - I'm back in Grand Rapids.
  - In G.R.? Why?
  - Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
  - I've got a meeting...
  - What are you paying me for?
  - I'll be there.
- - This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement
    case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city.
    With a downtown and all.
  - What have you found out?
  - I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
  - Where is she?
  - I don't know.
  - What do you mean?
  - Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
  - No.
  - Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
  - That's like a stag film.
  - Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
  - No.
  - They're legal now.
  - They are?
  - Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
  - Hmm.
  - There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it
    for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
- - Where is she?
  - I don't know.
  - Where did you get that film?
- - I bought it at a store in L.A.
  - Who made it?
  - I don't know.
  - What do you mean?
- - Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold
    outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible
    to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it
    doesn't even exist.
  - What's it called?
  - It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be
    called something else.
  - But the police...
  - The police? They know less than you do.
  - Do you think she's safe?
  - Yeah. Probably.
  - You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
  - I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this
    world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know
    about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing
    than a man should. Don't ask me why.
- - I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have
    told us something.
  - Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for?
    And in the middle of the morning, too.
- - Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
  - Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
- - I'm only human, you know.
  - Get out.
  - But this is my apartment.
  - Get out!
- - What are you doing here?
  - I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything
    wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in
    L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career.
    Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
  - Do the police want to arrest me?
  - Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your
    daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
  - Yeah, sure.
  - Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
  - You sure as hell haven't been any help.
  - I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
  - Why don't you tell me something for a change?
  - Like what?
  - Who is Ratan?
- - Where'd you hear that name?
  - I just heard. Who is he?
- - You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores,
    slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges
    such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear
    about him?
  - It's just a name.
  - Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
  - Does she know anything about this?
  - Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
- - What happened, pilgrim?
  - Just leave me alone.
  - But I'm here to help you...
- - Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
  - Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
- - Are you the star of this picture?
  - You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
  - The other girl is the star?
  - She thinks so.  What do you do?
  - I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
  - Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
- - Are you Niki?
  - Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
  - No.
  - Too bad. I wasn't in it.
- - It's your money. You talk.
  - I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where
    Tod is.
  - Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
  - Yeah.
  - You making a feature?
  - Um-hm. Live sound.
  - Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do
    this.
- - Joanne?
  - You know her?
  - No. I saw her with Tod.
  - Do you know where she lives?
  - Nah.
  - Do you know where she would be?
- - Where is she?
  - Tod might know.
  - Where's he?
  - Last I heard he went to San Diego.
  - If we went there, would you be able to find him?
  - You're not a film producer, are you?
  - How much do you make a week, Niki?
- - Are you a private detective?
  - Something like that. How much do you make?
  - Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
  - Three hundred?
  - This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
  - I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
  - Up front?
  - Half now, half later.
  - Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
  - Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
  - When do we start?
  - Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
  - This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
- - I thought you were going to bed?
  - I am.
- - No.
  - Huh?
  - Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back
    to your room and we'll get some sleep.
- - You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
  - I don't drink, but you can go out.
  - You don't drink?
  - Ulcers.
- - You're not a private detective either, are you?
  - No.
  - I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
  - A friend.
  - Of Joanne's?
  - Yeah.  I'm her father.
  - Jesus.
  - Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
  - And your wife? Where's she?
  - She's dead.
  - Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple
    days.
- - You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
  - At least I'm a growing person.
  - You won't keep growing at this rate.
  - What rate?
  - You know what I'm talking about.
  - You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys
    all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
  - Say what?
  - '''Sucking off.'''
  - Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
  - You don't understand shit.
  - Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
  - Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any
    food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't
    get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
  - Is that the way it was with you?
  - No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
- - Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're
    free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going
    to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my
    motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having
    every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing
    what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
  - You used to work at Copper Penny?
  - No.
  - You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
  - Why? Are you a sex fiend?
  - No.
  - Neither am I.
  - But it's all you do.
  - How important do you think sex is?
  - Not very.
  - We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex
    is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
- - I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you
    do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about
    movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
  - What do you care about?
  - I care about my daughter.
- - What's T-J?
  - Tijuana.
  - They were here?
  - Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
  - What does that mean?  What does he do?
  - He deals in pain.
  - Is Kristen safe?
- - You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit
    church?
  - Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
  - Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
  - They believe in the 'TULIP.'
  - What the crap?
  - It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different
    belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
  - Yeah, yeah, go on.
  - T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally
    evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of
    the Lord.'
  - Shit.
- - Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number
    of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of
    time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go
    to Heaven.
  - Fuck.
  - I can stop if you want.
  - No, please go on.
- - I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is
    for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from
    the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
  - Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you
    become saved, God already knows who you are?
  - He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything
    -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before
    the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
  - So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
  - More or less.
  - Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
  - Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses
    you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
  - You really believe all that?
  - Yeah.  Well, mostly.
  - I thought I was fucked up.
  - I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
  - If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts
    talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
  - It's not quite the same thing.
  - It doesn't make any sense to me.
- - Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him
    you were a 'specialty' customer.
  - Why can't I meet him now?
- - Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
  - Where does he live.
  - Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers
    don't mess around.
- - I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At
    least it feels that way.
  - I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
  - They are the same.
  - Do you live in a house back in wherever.
  - Grand Rapids? Of course.
  - On your own land?
- - Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
  - But what?
  - I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into
    the life.
  - What makes you so sure?
  - You wife isn't dead is she?
- - Why do you say that?
  - Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
- - She left you right?
  - Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
  - Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
- - I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's
    based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything.
    Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think
    they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
  - Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything
    I make goes to Granville.
  - Granville?
  - My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool
    'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take
    'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
- - Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
  - So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't
    get shit.
- - Did you find out where she was?
  - Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
  - What happened?
  - Where is he?
  - I can't tell you that.
- - Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot
    to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod
    slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
  - But then you'll forget about me.
  - Where is he, Niki?
- - Is this all the display space we can get?
  - I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
- - What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
  - I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
  - Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
  - Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
  - No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe
    we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
- - No, that would be much too overpowering.
  - Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
  - Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
  - What's that shade of blue called?
  - Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
- - Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
  - Sam?
  - Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a
    bit. It's a little...
  - Overpowering?
  - Yeah.
  - Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
  - Are you sure it's all right?
  - Yes. I think it'll look better.
  - If you say so.
- - Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
  - Yeah. How did you know?
- - Hello. You want some information?
  - Yeah.
  - We offer...
  - Yeah, yeah...
  - '...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.'
  - I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
  - I don't know no Tod.
  - What girls you got here?
  - My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
  - That's all you got, three girls?
  - Man, how many girls do you need?
  - I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
  - That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
- - I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
  - How many weeks?
  - Just one.
  - The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
- - '''Film Producer'' -- that should be in caps, bold face.'
  - Okay.
  - '''Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience
    a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.'
- - No.
  - We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of
    your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour.
    Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is
    permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
  - Yeah.
  - Do you want to take a session?
  - I just want to ask some questions.
  - You may do that in the privacy of your room.
  - Okay. I'll take a half hour.
  - Do you have any particular choice of girl?
  - You'll be fine.
- - You're still dressed?
  - Well, I want to...
  - Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
- - There's a girl I want to ask you about.
  - You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department,
    or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
  - No, I don't.
  - I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress
    less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that
    tie off.
- - Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
  - Pull out your cock.
  - What?
  - Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment.
    Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would
    make a girl unable to stop herself.
- - No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the
    police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
  - Are you going to stiff me?
  - What do you mean?
  - Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to
    the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a
    bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
  - You want a tip?
  - Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
  - What do you mean?
  - What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want,
    just say it.
  - I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
- - Now, what do you want?
  - I said I just wanted to talk to you...
  - That's cool.
  - '...about this woman.  I''m trying to find her. Do you know her?'
  - Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
- - I'm getting angry.
  - Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
  - I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
- - Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
  - Wait?
  - Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
- - Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB.
    How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
  - You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this
    kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going
    to have so much bad publicity, you...
  - I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do
    you really think he's in danger?
  - If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions
    and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including
    some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
  - We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
  - Big threat. TV would ream you.
  - Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
- - The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed
    everybody there.
  - But is she, has...
  - There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
  - There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
  - I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many
    others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes
    go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
  - What are you doing?
  - Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely,
    but we'll go through every lead.
- - You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
  - You mean I'm black?
  - No, just not the type.
  - What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've
    been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've
    worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it
    hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
  - I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing
    for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
  - Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam.
    I shouldn'ta come.
- - Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
  - No.
  - What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's
    twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may
    be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard,
    Master Charge and American Express.
  - I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
  - That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
- - No. I don't think so.
  - You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
- - We have this new club up here in Heaven.
  - Yes, we do.
  - We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
  - We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler
    plays shuffleboard.
  - Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
  - Mozart plays shuffleboard.
  - Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
  - Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
  - Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus
    Christ plays shuffleboard.
  - It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just
    another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know?
    He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the
    back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think
    there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
  - We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
  - You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We
    got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any
    kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a
    skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he
    never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the
    words, "Go take a flying--
- - Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
  - I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
  - Is that a fact?
  - That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
- - You've got to fight from time to time.
  - Not true.
  - Or get eaten alive.
  - That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
  - Phooey.
  - Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
- - We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
  - Penelope!  We're late!
- - The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
  - 'I''m sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect
    a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That''s the only way you
    can have a country!'
  - It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters
    thereon.
  - None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
  - Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and
    British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into
    a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor
    for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
  - You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit
    suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
- - Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
  - Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how
    it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis
    and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times
    Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
  - You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every
    day?
  - He died of a massive rupture.
  - You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't
    hurt yourself if you start out slow.
  - You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care
    of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't
    become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here
    was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their
    muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
- - Kid--kid--
  - It's good.  Let him go.
  - If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out
    we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm
    going to go get him--
  - Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There
    has never been a funeral for his father.
- - If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses
    around the fire--
  - What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
  - I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's
    birthday--
- - Minors aren't allowed at fights.
  - Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've
    got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm
    going to bring that boy back.
- - '"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"'
  - We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
- - I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening
    that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace
    violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
  - Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
- - Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
  - Take plenty of cigars.
  - We made the date three months ago.
  - I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also
    fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
  - She quit this afternoon.
- - The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
  - I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary
    death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she
    try antihistamines?
  - They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
  - Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
- - '"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.'
  - No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
- - Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
  - What?
  - Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly
    advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
- - I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
  - Tonight's the night.
- - This is very good for us.
  - It is?
  - The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
  - As long as he keeps out of the park.
  - After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother
    is going to marry again.
  - The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the
    sun goes down."
  - We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
  - That's the XKE.
  - The what?
  - It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it
    will fall into the hands of competition.
  - What kind of a life is that?
  - He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout
    when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not
    gone into the park!
  - If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
  - No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police
    won't even go in there any more.
  - I wish Paul luck.
  - It's suicide!
  - I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
  - Meaning?
  - Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through
    the park at midnight.
  - Why would you do that?
  - To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always
    for peace--
  - I'm amazed.
  - Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or,
    when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
  - And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
  - They didn't murder me.
  - Paul's only twelve years old.
  - He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
  - We've got to rescue him.
  - If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of
    that.
  - He's not your son.
  - No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the
    other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to
    walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
  - It's a jungle out there.
  - That's been said before.
  - He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a
    movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
- - You know each other?
  - We met here earlier this evening.
  - How neat.  How keen.
- - Thank you.  Thank you very much.
  - I believe in miracles now.
- - I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St.
    Louis--to visit an aunt.
  - Tell her to have a nice trip.
  - Thanks.
- - Get out of here.
  - It's really that bad?
- - You fool, you fool.
  - Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
- - Everything's going to be beautiful.
  - You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're
    not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to
    stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed.
    Go home!
- - Do it!
  - Goodbye.
- - Please--
  - He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
  - I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody
    be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
- - I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
  - Doing what?
  - He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
  - Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
  - He'd assume we had.
  - That's something I suppose.
  - All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you
    know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other
    people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner
    salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand
    dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they
    all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
  - I'm glad.
  - I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
  - I know.
  - If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to
    Vanderbilt.
  - I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
  - You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when
    I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold
    Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
- - Yes?
  - Something happens to my confidence.
  - This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was
    declared legally dead.
  - When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry
    about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be
    my wife.
  - I'm touched.
  - That's when I'll get my confidence back.
  - I see.
  - If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good
    night.
  - Good night.
- - Coming.
  - Women are always late.  You'll find out.
- - Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
  - Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
  - Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
- - What then?
  - We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul
    to the fight with us.
- - Did you see him?
  - Yeah.
  - Is he all right?
  - Far as I know.
  - Is he coming home?
  - He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in
    the park.
  - The park!
  - It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
  - I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
  - You figure!
  - Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
  - A what?
  - For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
  - How nice.
  - They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday,
    Somebody Else."
- - Did you talk to Paul?
  - Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment
    around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
  - We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And
    you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing
    about the key?
  - He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
  - What was it?
  - He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
- - What's the matter now?
  - We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
- - Possibly.
  - How long has this been going on?
  - A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
  - I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
  - I'm sorry.
  - Marry me instead.
  - Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects
    you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
  - You're saying no.
  - I'm saying no--and thank you.
  - I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
  - You were wonderful.
  - What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
- - It's true.
  - Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
- - You and Harold are friends?
  - He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy
    I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
- - Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
  - You're taking Mom out tonight?
  - You're going out?
- - We don't have a maid any more.
  - Oh?
- - Everything stays as it is!
  - A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros
    meat.
  - My father!
  - I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
  - Don't worry about it.
  - How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
  - It's fine!
  - It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor
    speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the
    sake of variety.
- - I hate that thing.
  - Keeps fairies away!
- - It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
  - Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
- - I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
  - He isn't any friend of Father.
  - He isn't?
  - He is my father.
  - No!
- - And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
  - He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
  - I told you this was a simple-minded play.
  - Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
  - I know.
  - Stay home tonight!
  - Oh, Paul--
  - You're married!  You've already got a husband!
  - He's a ghost!
  - He's alive!
  - Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
  - If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle
    and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
  - Thank you, kind sir.
  - A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
  - A what kind of doctor?
  - A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
  - That's an interesting piece of news.
  - You're the only woman he ever took out.
  - Not true.
  - Still lives with his mother.
  - You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband,
    who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
  - How did she lose her feet?
  - In a railroad accident many years ago.
  - I was afraid to ask.
  - Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood
    company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his
    mother.
  - I didn't know that.
  - A lot of people don't.
  - J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
  - I don't really know.
  - To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid
    peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
- - I hate that thing.
  - It's beautiful.
- - Where will you be?
  - Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
- - Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
  - Who have you been talking to?
  - What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
- - Yes, he is.
  - Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- - Is Norbert still here?
  - No.
  - Then who flushed the toilet?
  - Father's friend.
  - What's his name?
  - Don't know.
  - For Heaven's sakes!
- - Mom?
  - That man is your father.
  - What?
  - There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
  - I don't get it.
  - It is you, isn't it, Harold?
- - That's why I'm crying.
  - Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
- - What are his symptoms?
  - Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
  - What does he say to do?
  - He can hardly talk.
- - Really?
  - It is an emergency, isn't it?
  - Yeah.
  - Then get him.
  - Okay.
- - She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars
    back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your
    mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
  - I don't care what she wears.
  - Something's made you sore.
  - Don't worry about it.
  - You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
  - It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
  - I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
  - She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope
    you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up
    even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
  - Kid--kid--
  - And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
  - What's this?
  - Don't!
  - You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
  - Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
- - Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
  - Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football
    players after they've won the Superbowl?
- - I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he
    shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
  - Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
- - Thank God!
  - What a relief!
- - That goes double for me.
  - I don't want to live any more.
  - I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
  - I'll kill myself.
  - The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western
    Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
- - Don't touch me.
  - Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
  - No.
  - All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together,
    Penelope.
- - Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
  - I heard you were looking for me.
  - You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
  - Yes.
  - You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak
    up the back?
  - Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
- - Because he was cruel?
  - Premature ejaculation.
  - Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold
    would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with
    his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of
    stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now
    earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He
    would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That
    was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me
    to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended
    I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then
    he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little
    kids.  Any little kids.
  - That is sad.
  - Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
  - Ja?
  - Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything
    is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
- - Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
  - Thought you were another wife, maybe.
  - I'm only ten years old.
  - That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari,
    and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
  - Won't you please join our club? Please?
  - Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an
    individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two
    wives to drink.
- - Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
  - Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second
    World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
  - I dunno, boy.
  - You don't know?
  - It was a bitch.
  - Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
- - And you went home unannounced, too?
  - I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
- - Alice got married again.
  - She did?
  - You didn't even find that out?
  - There was so much going on.
  - She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
  - So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum."
    I thought it was some foreign language.
- - Dead!
  - Jesus.
  - Alice is dead?
  - No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
  - For what?
  - For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
  - Who's dead?
  - My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
  - What happened?
  - Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang
    the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I
    said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
  - How horrible.
  - Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up
    the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler
    was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe
    not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
- - 'And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don''t know.'
  - I dunno.
- - So long, you guys.
  - What will you do, Colonel?
  - I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle
    shop.  So long, you guys.
- - Ooops.
  - Ooops.
  - Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
  - Gentlemen--that's nice.
  - You startled me.
- - The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
  - It's always locked.
  - But here you are inside, aren't you?
  - You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
  - We tried to be.  We tried to be.
  - He's dead, you know.
  - Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
- - Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
  - Hello, Mother.
  - '...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh
    dear.'
  - Oh dear.
  - Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect
    her.  I'll leave right now.
- - Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
  - We'll miss you so.
  - Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't
    be home for a while.
  - Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
  - I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital
    now.  An emergency.
- - I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were
    here.  You can come back later.
  - Ahh--then she's still alive.
  - She's fine.  Please--
  - And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
  - Will you please go?  An emergency!
  - She still has just the one child-- the boy?
- - Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
  - And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
  - Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
  - And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various
    health matters?
  - Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
- - Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
  - And her fianc!
  - And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says
    to the woman?
  - I've got to run!
- - You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's
    how it goes.
  - I've literally got to run!
  - I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
- - Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
  - I came back.
- - How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
  - A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
  - Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
  - Are--are you crying, Penelope?
  - She's crying because she's so happy.
- - I feel the same way.  What next?
  - What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home
    this is--
  - None.
  - Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance
    this household could have at this time.  Good night.
  - Good night.
- - Ah!  You're ambulatory!
  - What a brilliant diagnosis!
- - Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria,
    perhaps?
  - I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
  - You've been bitten by bats?
  - Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a
    flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper
    lost his little toe.
  - You have chills?
  - 'Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the
    Woodly galloping crud."'
- - You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
  - I was going to ask.
  - Pacqualinincheewa root.
  - Would you say that again?
  - Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak
    down the back.
  - I've never heard of it.
  - Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet,
    you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
  - Are you've seen it work cures?
  - Hundreds.
- - Wasn't that sweet of me?
  - More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the
    pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing
    things.
  - We have, have we?
  - That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
  - Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd
    disappear.
- - Good Lord.
  - 'I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying
    in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered
    it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes
    with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."'
- - I thought she was a widow.
  - You were wrong, you quack!
- - I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
  - What for?
  - Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the
    American people could do without.  Goodbye.
- - It died for your sins.
  - This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
  - There's a certain amount of information there.
  - Lest we forget how cruel you are.
- - This is man to man.
  - It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
  - What brought you back?
  - The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, "
    if you like.
  - 'He''s a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for
    our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.'
- - 'There''s going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he''ll fight--the only way
    he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?'
  - Yes.
  - I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But
    he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan
    with words. The truth!  Correct?
  - Correct.
  - What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
  - You haven't heard me yet.
  - You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who
    will clean up this awful mess?
  - We'll find out now, won't we?
- - You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
  - Oooooo.  That hurt.
  - You're old--so old.
  - Now who's being cruel?
  - A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
  - We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling
    me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me
    a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
- - You're a son of a bitch.
  - Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically
    requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off
    an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
- - I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
  - Comical?
- - Hands and knees, you say?
  - And terror, if you don't mind.
- - You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
  - I'm high as a kite.
  - Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
  - You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
  - I love you!  Have a cigar!
  - Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
  - I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
  - If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
  - This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
  - You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
  - I'm an honorable clown?
  - King Arthur.
  - You hope.
  - In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
  - No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
  - Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
  - Cut me open.  Find out.
  - I've struck my blow.
  - With spittle?
  - I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You
    refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover
    of peace!
  - I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every
    lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown,
    clown, clown."
  - Poison.
  - You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking
    itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is,
    "Yes."
  - I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
  - You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've
    protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way
    up here to eat us alive?
  - No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by
    a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed
    with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
  - I see.
  - You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any
    violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
  - Don Quixote.
  - My violin is avenged!
  - Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
  - And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
  - The new hero is you.
  - I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
  - You're too modest.
  - But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm
    you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
  - Was I ever of use?
  - Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source
    of agony of mankind.
- - Here.  Finish the job.
  - I'm utterly satisfied.
  - You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when
    wounded.  You've wounded me.
  - More clowning!  Don't you see?
  - We never quit fighting until we're dead.
  - You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
  - I'm going to shoot you now.
  - No!
  - My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy
    for me to shoot an unarmed man.
  - New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
  - Like the saber-toothed tiger.
  - Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting
    of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
  - Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
  - If you want to be found that way.
  - What is this thing that kills me?
  - Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's
    time, it's time.
  - Don't shoot.
  - I've enjoyed being man.
- - No.  No.
  - Get up.
  - No.
  - Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
- - Can't do it.
  - Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
- - Thank you--for my life.
  - It's trash now, like mine.
  - New lives begin!
  - Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my
    clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
  - What are you going to do?
  - Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
  - Leave the rifle here.
  - I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
  - Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
  - For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
- - How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about
    men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
  - I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars
    of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other
    animals as well--for sport.
- - '"Hamburger Heaven."'
  - Heaven.
- - Can I help you, sir?
  - I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
  - Eighteen--  and a half.
  - A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
  - Sir?
  - Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do
    you understand?
  - Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water
    buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
  - What time do you get off work, my child?
  - I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went
    out with another man.
  - Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
  - I'm engaged.
  - Daughter--I love you very much.
  - You don't even know me.
  - You are woman.  I know woman well.
  - This is crazy.
  - Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
  - What do you do for a living?
  - My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They
    left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've
    just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
  - Some kind of animal?
  - The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
- - How do you do?
  - How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I
    intruding here?
  - Not at all.
  - I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
- - What's the matter?
  - Give us time.
  - Like hugging a lamp post.
  - Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
  - You were well adjusted to my being dead?
  - We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust
    to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll
    be as quick as I can.
  - What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
  - I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
  - Disease?
  - Situation.
  - This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
  - A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
  - Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
  - Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
  - You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
  - Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
- - Bluh.
  - You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
- - What's that all about?
  - We thought a doctor might help.
  - Your old beau?
  - We thought it was an emergency.
  - I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
  - He's a very decent man, Harold.
  - We all are.
  - Shouldn't you lie down?
  - When I'm dead--  or fucking.
  - Paul said you were awfully sick.
  - I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
- - You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect
    you both. You should be friends.
  - Nothing would please me more.
  - Thank God!
- - I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
  - Have some.
- - Harold!
  - I could carve a better man out of a banana!
  - Please--
  - You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You
    know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men
    with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering,
    ingratitude, loneliness, death--
- - He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
  - He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous
    account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
- - Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
  - Say hello to your mother.
  - Do say hello to your mother.
- - Now that's what I call fun.
  - Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
  - You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
  - I did?
  - We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's
    start right now.
  - A trip, you mean?
  - I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
- - He hasn't had breakfast yet.
  - Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
- - 'Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!'
  - It's so--so stark.
  - You used to like it stark!
  - Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
  - I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue
    pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm
    your husband.  Society approves!
- - Now--turn around, if you would.
  - Turn around?
  - I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a
    perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
- - I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense,
    so tense.
  - You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
  - You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget
    Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
  - I have a brain.
  - We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should
    feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper
    bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go
    slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now
    the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
- - I have some change!
  - Ram it up your ass!
- - Breakfast?
  - Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to
    eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
- - And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
  - Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
  - All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel.
    Penelope will bring you some chow.
  - That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
  - Which one?
  - '"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."'
  - She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure
    happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
  - What a honeymoon.
  - Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I
    have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with
    Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
  - You're wrong.
  - Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
- - Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
  - We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
  - You're a woman, aren't you?
- - Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
  - People don't use that word any more.
  - Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've
    been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind
    of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been
    to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
  - You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
  - People now have dignity when frying eggs?
  - They don't have to feel like slaves.
  - Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
- - I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should
    have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
  - I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
  - I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do
    such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're
    starving.  Do you mind?
- - Let me guess--breakfast is served?
  - No.
  - What then?
  - I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard
    it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
  - That's what you're supposed to say.
  - This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want
    tenderness.
  - You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
  - I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the
    throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't
    feel.
  - It couldn't!
  - I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
  - Fish can't feel.
  - Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm
    not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop,
    I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have
    ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has
    to do with you.
  - Such as?...
  - The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
  - Tell me about its sexual roots.
  - It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound
    insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the
    truth.
  - I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans
    truth ever had.
  - Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very
    long, and make awful messes while they're there.
  - Go on.
  - And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One
    reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have
    to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for
    revenge.
  - You learned this in some college course?
  - I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
  - The doctor.
  - Yes.
  - And what is his most cherished possession?
  - His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
  - And he keeps it in his apartment?
  - Yes.
  - And no one's there now?
  - I don't think so.
  - That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
  - What are you going to do?
  - He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion
    women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his
    door and I'm going to smash his violin.
  - No you're not!
  - Why not?
  - Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
- - I came for my clothes.
  - Sneaking in the back door.
  - I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
  - Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the
    Department of Sanitation.
  - I came for Paul as well.
  - If he wants to go.
  - You took him to the funeral, I hear.
  - He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
  - A dozen?
  - It's a big and busy funeral home.
  - Did you like it, dear?
  - It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly
    natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan,
    and then comes back--for anything.
  - Unless she has nerve.
  - More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has
    he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
  - He knows you shattered his violin.
  - I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the
    smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
  - He cried.
  - About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley
    cat.
  - Two hundred years old.
  - He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
  - He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
  - Hope.
- - Things.
  - You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
- - Well--what have we here?  A family.
  - Almost a Christmas scene.
  - Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
  - Just one favor.
  - Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get
    the baseball team.
  - I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
- - Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's
    a failing, I know.
  - I see.
- - See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
  - How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
  - He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
  - Rifle?
  - I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And
    where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
  - He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
  - Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
  - He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know
    anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
  - And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
  - It seems highly intelligent to me.
  - What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and
    the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the
    blue soup.
  - Blue soup?
  - An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored
    haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When
    a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister,
    we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We
    had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise
    Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise
    Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic
    system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never
    stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in
    that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
  - Sounds quite beautiful.
  - Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven
    years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams!
    Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
  - Like what?
  - Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
- - He's a child!
  - With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
  - You're begging him to kill you?
  - If he thinks he's man enough.
  - That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
  - I'm teaching my son to be a man.
  - So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to
    kill you.
  - I plan to live one hundred years!
  - No you don't.
  - If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
  - Honor, I suppose.
  - What a handsome word.
  - But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When
    you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You
    honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
  - If you've lived a good life, fought well--
  - It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than
    the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that
    crowns them all.
  - May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
- - The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who
    refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle,
    no point to battle anymore.
  - I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have
    to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you
    know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis,
    Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
  - No.
  - No.
- - And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher,
    too?
  - I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
  - You hope this, too?
- - I'm going to call the police.
  - Don't!
- - This is suicide.  Go get the police.
  - Stop!
- - No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always
    does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
  - There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some
    sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
- - I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
  - Ah!  The lady is armed.
  - I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the
    chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
  - Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's
    the American way.
  - I mean it!
  - Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
  - Where's the bullet?
- - Help your mother find the bullet.
  - There it is.  Give it to me.
- - How do I load?
  - Load it for her.
- - All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
  - The National Safety Council would be appalled.
  - Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate
    you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when
    you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool,
    you fool.
- - She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
  - Out!
- - Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
  - You've killed women?
  - Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
- - Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
  - Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and
    promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
  - Do it, Norbert.
- - Anybody home?
  - As a matter of fact--
  - Sir?
  - As a matter of fact--I am home.
  - Hello.
  - Hello.
  - Are you--
- - You were about to ask a question?
  - Are you--do you--
  - Ask it!
  - Do you know who Wanda June is?
  - Life has denied me that thrill.
  - Do you mind if I ask who you are?
  - Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the
    family physician let me in a while ago.
  - Dr. Woodly.
  - Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
  - Is anybody besides you here now?
  - The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
  - Where's Mom?
  - You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking
    all night?
  - She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
  - You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
  - I'll see.
- - And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
  - I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing
    doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
  - Man and boy.
  - Everybody says he was so brave.
  - Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
  - He worships Father.
  - Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
  - He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
  - I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and
    your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
  - She met him at college.
  - College!
  - They were in the same creative writing class.
  - College?
  - She has a master's degree in English literature.
  - What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss
    watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
  - He insults him all the time.
  - Excellent!
  - What's good about that?
  - It makes life spicy.
  - He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he
    called Father one time?
  - No.
  - '"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."'
  - What does he do--of an athletic nature?
  - Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
  - Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
  - He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
  - Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
  - Tell me some true stories about Dad.
  - '"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.'
  - England?
  - Oh hell.
  - Dad was never in England?
  - Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A
    city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing
    and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing
    he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the
    choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham
    Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the
    sting."
  - '"The sting."'
  - As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds
    more.
  - '"The sting."'
  - Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla
    band--in the war against the Nazis.
  - Tell me that.
  - I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia,
    hand to hand.
  - Tell me that!  Tell me that!
  - Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through
    field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted
    by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the
    most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
  - Wow.
  - We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into
    the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
  - Mhravitch.
  - We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter
    a sound.
  - Uck.
  - Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
  - I don't know.
  - The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
  - Go on.
  - We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death
    with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's
    nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The
    face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At
    any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management,
    we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
  - Where did you get the poison?
  - We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were
    captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than
    we did at the time.
  - And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and
    he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills
    and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your
    father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil
    War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am
    Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of
    Yugoslavia."
- - Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
  - Mhravitch.
  - The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
  - When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
  - It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
  - Sir?
  - The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted
    turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying
    of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had
    butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
  - I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
  - You're supposed to get hurt!
  - Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He
    says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
  - Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
  - They're not engaged.
  - He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
  - Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
  - You're a very good boy to respond that way.
  - No, no, no, no, no.
  - I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
  - Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
- - Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
  - Sir?
- - Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
  - Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
  - Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is
    your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
  - She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
  - Why don't you go to bed--son.
  - I can't take my eyes off you.
  - Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said
    about you?
  - Can't it keep till morning?
  - She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father
    is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
  - That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then
    you thank her in the morning.
  - Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
  - Penelope!
  - She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
  - Penelope!
  - She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they
    got her.
  - Will you go to bed?
  - Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
  - Scat!
- - Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
  - Damn.
  - Mom?
- - Play?
  - Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
- - A hundred dollars!
  - The smallest thing I've got.
  - Can I get dressed first?
  - Make it fast.
- - Dad--
  - Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
  - A hundred dollars for breakfast?
  - Leave a tip.
- - What kind of exercise?
  - Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
- - I'm a man.
  - We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't
    get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
  - No.
  - You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with
    the women, just say the word.
- - Dad?
  - Who was it?
  - It's Mom.
- - Mom?
  - What's this?
- - What's this?
  - Nothing.
  - That's a rifle you have?
  - No.
  - Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
  - No.
  - Open the bolt!
- - That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and
    fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
  - Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
  - Gee whiz, Dad--
  - Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
  - Dad--
  - Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect
    her!`
- - Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
  - I don't want to fight you.
  - Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish
    I'd never come home!
  - It's your house, Dad.
  - Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or
    to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East
    St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman
    and a child and a violin.
- - I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You
    don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You
    talk to everybody just the same.
  - I'm talking to you gently now.
  - Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
- - Hello.
  - How are you, honeybunch?
  - Is Penelope in?
  - The posies are for her?
  - I wanted to apologize.
  - You've come to the right man.
  - I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
  - I forget mine for years on end.
  - Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
- - I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper
    are my friends.
  - Our pleasure.
  - Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
  - For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have
    been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo
    Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
  - Blue soup.
  - It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical
    castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
- - Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
  - I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
  - Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
  - What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
  - Pass the fucking catsup.
- - Insurance!
  - You actually sold insurance!
- - What an awful sound!
  - Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
- - It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
  - I've considered that.
  - Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
  - I just want one true adventure before I die.
  - That can be arranged.
- - Fifty years?
  - You're making a joke.
  - I'm interested in long-term expectations.
  - It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
  - Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
- - If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
  - Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things,
    your things!
- - Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
  - What?
  - We got to get another pilot.
  - For what?
  - For Africa.
  - Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner
    salesman?
  - You invited me.
  - To make an ass of yourself.
  - What went wrong?
  - We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have
    found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
  - Gee whiz--
  - It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant
    charged us.
  - I wouldn't drop my gun.
  - You're hollow, like a woman.
  - I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
  - He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper
    profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards
    every one.
  - How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
  - Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug
    me!
  - You're my buddy.
  - Out!  Out!
  - No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
  - Out!
  - You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
  - Thank God!
- - Miss me, baby?
  - I dunno, boy.
  - Hm?
  - It's a bitch.
  - A bitch.
  - Didn't recognize you.
  - We've never met.
  - I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
  - I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
  - I'm gonna wet my pants.
- - Home, sweet home.
  - One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice
    threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
  - We'll see.
- - It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why
    don't you run on home while the evening's young.
  - Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
  - Home is important to a man.
  - You know what gets me?
  - No.
  - How all the magazines show tits today.
  - Um.
  - Used to be against the law, didn't it?
  - I suppose.
  - Must have changed that law.
- - Home.
  - You know what gets me?
- - You know what gets me?
  - Oh, shit.
  - How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless
    I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and
    "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened
    while we were out of the country.
  - Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
  - At least we found the diamonds.
  - At least!
  - I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
  - It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
  - I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
  - Tell them yourself!
  - You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
  - After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know
    anybody in the universe!
  - I didn't tell you everything.
  - The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything
    about Mrs. Wheeler.
  - I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's
    here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
  - This room is full of ghosts.
  - You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
- - You know what gets me?
  - Go home!
  - Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
  - The hell with the diamonds!
  - You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
  - Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
  - Can I have the Cadillac?
  - Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
  - What'll you do for transportation?
  - I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
  - You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
  - Go home!
  - When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I
    don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's
    a bitch.
  - Go home.
  - I'm liable to find anything!
  - That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice
    can cover it up.
  - I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky,
    looking in the window there, and there she was.
  - So long, Colonel.
  - You know what gets me?
  - Let's talk about it some other time.
  - How short the skirts are.
  - Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
  - Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
- - You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
  - Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time
    has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion
    in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
  - Months?
  - I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will
    not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at
    a parting of the ways.
  - I'm lonesome already.
- - I've been looking at motorcycles.
  - Go home!
  - You ever own a motorcycle?
  - You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to
    talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
  - Haven't got one.
- - And how were things?
  - Let's talk about something else.
- - Otherwise, how are things?
  - I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
- - Could have happened to anybody.
  - First Nagasaki--now this.
  - How about breakfast, wife?
- - I dunno, boy.
  - The educational process.
  - I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
  - She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
- - What's funny about that?
  - You know me, boy.
- - Excuse me.
  - One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness--
    maudlin concern.
  - Huh.
  - He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
  - He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything
    but a jockstrap.
  - How do you know that?
  - You told me.
  - When?
  - When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
  - Oh.  I'd forgotten.
  - Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
  - Really?
  - You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's
    going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
  - Sorry.
- - Go to the funeral?
  - Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
  - That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
  - Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
  - Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
  - 'When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted
    oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I
    now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men
    in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.'
  - I didn't know we had any women left.
  - The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
  - Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
- - I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
  - It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
  - You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on
    the surface sometime.
- - So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
  - He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
- - Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
  - I dunno.
  - You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
  - Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to
    come back to anymore.
  - All the more reason to go to Africa.
  - I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
  - You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
  - I dunno.
  - She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted
    to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his
    wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
- - Hi, Penelope.
  - Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
- - Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want
    to be married to him.  You know?
  - What's this?
  - I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
  - In what way, pray tell?
  - I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
  - Tit for tat--as simple as that.
  - You never played a violin.
  - You did?
  - Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking,
    "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That
    belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some
    fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to
    myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
  - Maybe it's time you got out.
  - Me?
  - You.
  - Okay.  Okay.
  - You're an imbecile.
  - I know you think that.
  - Everybody thinks that.
  - Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
  - The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
  - I don't think so.  It could have been.
  - If what?
  - If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all
    those people down there live."
  - They were enemies.  We were at war.
  - Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves
    sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You
    could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know
    how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father
    of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the
    bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
  - Goodbye, Looseleaf.
- - Yes?
  - Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
  - I'm sorry, but do I know you --
  - I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting
    for me that night --
- - Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
  - Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
- - What do you know about Michael?
  - I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But
    I know. I've always known.
  - Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her
    life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
  - No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
- - Who else knew I had the baby?!
  - No one.
  - No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
  - Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
- - Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
  - No!!!
- - Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
  - That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
- - 'Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of
    my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  ''Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.''  Or,
    in this case, a drink is just a drink.'
  - I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
  - As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've
    come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess
    who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
  - But surely Rogers isn't --
  - Retiring.
- - We need you, Dr. Loomis.
  - You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
  - You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm
    recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is
    your change to finally make a difference.
- - But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think
    it over.
  - Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
- - It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
  - You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
  - It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever
    has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
  - After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
  - That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel
    him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched
    him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my
    colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I
    need your help to stop him.
- - Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff
    on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive,
    I plan on bringing him back.
  - Or what's left of him.
- - What is that?
  - It's a sign.  He's come home.
- - Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
  - I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
- - There you are.  Who was that boy?
  - An old friend.
- - There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary
    school.
  - Any word on the location of the Strodes?
  - No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
  - Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
- - What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
  - I'll meet you over there.
- - Where's the child?
  - Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right
    back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
- - Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this
    must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm
    in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all,
    you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't
    the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
  - This is madness, Wynn.
  - Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've
    just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside
    has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal
    watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although
    after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And
    what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
  - It was you.
  - Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
  - Why did you take Jamie?
  - She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother
    had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael
    has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
  - Jamie's baby ...
  - There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless
    generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
  - Samhain.
  - And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect
    it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
- - You've created a monster.
  - Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
- - No!!!
  - Stay away, Sam.
  - Leave the boy.  Take me.
- - She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
  - Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
- - My, God!  What have you done to him?
  - I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
  - You stay away from him!
- - Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
  - Him.
- - God, what's wrong with him?
  - Here.  Let me try.
- - Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
  - Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
  - Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
- - It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter
    or number or --
  - It's a rune ... Thorn.
- - Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands
    of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of
    all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood
    rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
  - Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine
    and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered
    human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
  - Halloween.
  - '''When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them
    confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'''
- - Where are you going?
  - To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been
    controlling him.
- - Danny?!  Danny!
  - Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
- - Where's the baby?!
  - He's gone.
- - Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
  - Kara, no!
- - What now?!
  - Wait a minute ...
- - Come on!
  - It's not working!
- - So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens
    to be Rosemary.
  - No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
- - Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
  - It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
- - So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens
    to be Rosemary.
  - No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
  - Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
  - It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
- - I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
  - Who are you?
  - I've come to help your family.
- - He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room.
    Right here. Where it all began.
  - What makes you think he'll come here again?
  - This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs.
    Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her
    daughter.
  - Jamie?  But I thought she was --
  - Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
- - What should I do?
  - Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield
    as possible.
  - God ... this can't be true.
  - Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until
    you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
- - Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
  - Relax, John.  They were just kids.
  - Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn
    respect.
- - See what I'm talkin' about?
  - You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
- - What is it this time?
  - A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
- - He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
  - What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
  - John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
  - What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening
    to those damned talk shows?
  - I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing
    with.  John, I want you to come with us.
  - Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
  - You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
- - Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
  - The voice man!  He's here!
- - Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college.
    Remember our deal.
  - The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live
    here.
  - They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
  - But I've seen him!
  - You've been watching too much TV.
  - He says things.  Bad things.
  - Like what?
- - No, Mom -- keep it on!
  - Okay ... But just for tonight.
- - Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
  - You can't expect us to stay here --
- - Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
  - Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
- - Mommy, I'm scared.
  - There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some
    sleep.
  - I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
  - No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
  - Promise?
  - I promise.
- - Mommy!!!
  - Danny!!!
- - Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
  - Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's
    only Halloween.
- - Whatever happened to women in back?
  - Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
- - Happy fuckin' Halloween.
  - Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
- - Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ...
    Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty
    ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
  - Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
- - Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
  - Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
  - Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them.
    There's nothing else for us to do here.
  - But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
  - We can light our own tree at home.
- - Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
  - Guess so ...
- - What if your parents come home?
  - Then they can watch.
- - Aren't you gonna answer that?
  - Answer what?
  - What if it's Kara?
- - He do that to you?
  - Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
  - Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
- - Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
  - Why?  You interested?
  - No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
  - You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly
    some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's
    harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
- - Mom -- Who is this?
  - Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
  - What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
  - We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
  - Is Tim there?
  - He's in the bathroom.
- - You aced it, didn't you?
  - I did alright.
- - Fuckin' A.
  - He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
- - What's this?
  - You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
- - Better her than me.
  - You're unbelievable.
- - Ooooh, busted.
  - Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows
    about this one by tonight.
- - Shane's going as a condom.
  - I thought you were allergic to latex.
  - I'll pop a Benadryl.
  - You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
  - Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
- - BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
  - Shit, Linda!
  - You're so easy...
  - Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
  - Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
  - Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
  - Thanks!
  - Where's Shane?
  - Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
  - But the dance is in the gymnasium.
  - Very insightful.
- - Let the party begin.
  - Have enough fun for the both of us.
  - Oh, don't be such a victim.
- - Look, they're staring right at us.
  - You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
- - Wait.
  - What is it?
  - I have to pee.
  - Can't you hold it?
  - Can't you?
- - Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
  - Looks great.  It does.
  - You okay?  You seem a little off.
  - Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
- - It's John, isn't it?
  - It's always John.
  - Still wants to move out?
  - He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
  - This kid just wants his freedom.
  - It's not going to happen.
  - The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
  - Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
  - Doesn't make it bad advice.
- - I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
  - A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
  - Bye Will.
- - Hey, you alright?
  - What?
  - What are you looking at?
  - I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
- - There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
  - What?
  - My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
  - You're right.  It does sound strange.
- - Who?
  - Michael Meyers.
  - The serial killer?
  - He's my brother.
- - No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
  - I can't believe this is happening.
  - Shit happens.
- - You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
  - Are you going to leave, too?
  - Never.
- - So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
  - Yeah.
  - Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
- - Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
  - Oh, right.  Sorry.
  - I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
  - Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light
    of my feet.
- - Keri, you all right?
  - We've got to get these kids out of here...
  - I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
- - Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
  - I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's
    the only way I can afford to stay here.
  - Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow
    night.
  - Okay... thank you.
- - Linda!  He killed Linda!
  - Who?!
  - Michael Meyers!
- - Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
  - Where'd you get it?
  - Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
  - You stole it?
  - I borrowed it.
- - Not me.
  - Why not?
  - I can't afford to get caught.
- - Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
  - Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe
    she's in trouble.
- - What are you doing here?!
  - I came to see you.
  - I can see that.  Why?
  - Can I come in?
  - Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
  - Then you come out here.
  - Then I'll get caught.
  - Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
  - Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
- - You really think Eddie killed her?
  - You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come
    up with something like that.
  - I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
- - You look kind of cold.
  - I'm okay.
  - Here, take my jacket.
- - Better?
  - Yeah.
- - Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's
    still "no."
  - You're so predictable.
- - What the --
  - Betcha' didn't predict that.
- - I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
  - And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of
    luck.
  - Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
  - No.
- - Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
  - You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter
    top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
  - I promise not to run off to Cancun.
  - Forget it.
  - The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So,
    what difference does it make?
  - My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
- - Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies
    and living with your mother and school headmaster.
  - I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
  - My life is a living hell.
- - Where are you going?
  - To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
  - I thought you'd never ask.
- - You're twisted.
  - I know.
- - Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
  - Nothing.
  - You're kidding with that answer, right?
  - I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
  - Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether
    you like it or not.
  - Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
  - It's an option.
  - Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to
    spend time with my friends.
  - Oh, so now it's my fault?
  - Just forget it...
- - I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
  - Will, sit down...
- - You some kind of fugitive or something?
  - I was trying to get away from someone.
- - Now you're joking, right?
  - Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
- - Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
  - Yes.
  - Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
  - No.
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  - I was trying to protect you from this...
- - Where are you going?
  - I don't know.
- - He found you, didn't he?
  - Get on the bus.
  - Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
  - Just get on the bus.
  - I'm not leaving without her.
  - John, you can't help her now.
  - What?  Where is she?
  - John...
- - Oh, God... no... not Molly.
  - Please, get on the bus...
- - Yeah, me too, Keri.
  - Call me Laurie, will ya?
  - Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
  - That would work.
- - Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
  - My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
  - Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
  - I think someone broke into my house.
  - No shit?!
  - No shit.
- - Jimmy, what are you doing?
  - Checking out your place.
  - No.  Wait for the police.
  - And miss the big game?  No way.
- - Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
  - You sure?
  - Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
  - Nothing's missing?
  - Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
  - My office?
  - Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
- - Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
  - What the fuck are you talking about?
  - Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
  - Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
  - It's not historically accurate, that's all.
- - Another historical inaccuracy.
  - Would somebody shut this guy up?
- - Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the
    festival.
  - Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
- - A dead body?
  - It's Amy Kramer.
  - My god...
  - Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying
    to get a hold of you...
- - Do you know who did this?
  - Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never
    came home last night. Car's still missing.
  - Think Eddie had something to do with it?
  - Doesn't look good.
- - I'll be damned.
  - Do I know you?
- - Mind if we sit down?
  - I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
  - Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
  - Detective...
  - Carter.
  - '... I think it would be best if you both left.'
  - Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
  - I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school
    is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
  - Funny, we just drove right in.
  - Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
- - No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
  - It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
- - Why am I here?
  - They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
  - With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois
    on Michael Meyers.
  - Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was
    ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes
    Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
  - Well, when you put it that way.
  - Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
  - I like a woman who takes control.
- - One set of muddy shoe prints.
  - That don't match either of the victim's.
- - Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open
    the window before banging on it like hell.
  - Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
  - No blood on the knife.
- - The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
  - Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
- - As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
  - Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
- - Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
  - Girl scouts.
- - Carter.
  - It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
  - Where?
  - The cemetery...
  - Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
- - You take all your dates here. Blake?
  - Only the real stiffs.
  - I can be real stiff.
  - Charming.
- - That's it?
  - Care to join me?
  - Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
  - What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white
    mask dragging a headstone?
  - Yes.
  - Sweet dreams, Blake.
- - Carter.
  - It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
- - We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
  - The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
- - Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
  - Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
- - Mr. Simms.
  - Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
  - Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
- - Well, thank you. And thank them.
  - Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
  - That's true, Mr. Simms.
  - We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed
    thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just
    when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent
    waves.
  - Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
  - Happy to see you looking so good.
- - Roy Dillon?
  - Yes?
  - Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
  - Thank you.
- - I realize this is a shock.
  - Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
  - That's natural.
  - No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing
    would make her check out.
  - I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
  - Gun?
  - I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it,
    but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
  - It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
  - Do you have any particular reason to say that?
  - My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She
    always knew they might turn on her some day.
  - A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly
    consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
- - Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
  - You up to it now?
  - Sure. Let's get it over.
  - One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
  - Yes, I know, I know.
  - Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
  - What?
  - I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the
    truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
  - Ate the gun. Oh.
  - Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's
    just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
  - Well, let's get the shock over with.
- - Not many laughs in this room, eh?
  - Not many.
- - Oh, Jesus.
  - No question, huh?
  - No, its -- Why did she--?
- - That's that, then.
  - Oh, yeah. That's that.
- - Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
  - Always, for you, baby.
- - You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
  - Taking you for granite?
- - That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
  - Are you sure?
  - Let's find out.
- - Roy?
  - Mm?
  - Look at me.
  - Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
  - Roy? It this all we have?
  - All? It ain't bad.
  - No more than this?
- - What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
  - I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
- - Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
  - No, baby. Come to Mama.
- - You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
  - You called the doctor, huh?
  - Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
  - Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
- - Her job.
  - I want to know everything about you.
  - You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
- - I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
  - I just do what the doctor says, babe.
  - You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie
    around, let your mama take care of you.
  - Mama!
  - Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you
    sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
  - I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
  - I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes
    remarks.
  - That's just Lilly's way.
  - And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
  - Oh, don't be stupid.
  - You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
- - Get well soon.
  - Every day in every way.
  - I'll see you when you get home.
- - I don't see why we have to take the train.
  - Because it's comfortable.
- - What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
  - We'll rent a car.
- - Big spender.
  - You ain't seen nothin.
- - No.
  - See you soon.
- - You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
  - I'll sign that affidavit.
  - Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
  - You already went back to work.
  - What?
  - I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
  - Working the what?
  - Oh, come on, Roy.
- - The tap. What you do for a living.
  - I'm a salesman.
  - You're on the grift. Same as me.
  - Myra, I'm not following this.
  - Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like
    I'm another square.
- - You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
  - The long end. Big con.
  - Nobody does that single-o.
  - I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
  - I've heard the name.
  - It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
  - Is that right?
  - It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've
    been in the game.
- - He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with
    the mark.
  - And when he got serious?
  - He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the
    SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty
    thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one
    sucker!
  - I thought these people were broke.
  - No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses
    to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they
    put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's
    the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over
    to Cole.
  - And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
  - No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
  - Yeah? How?
- - Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only
    pulled two or three scams a year.
  - What happened to Cole?
  - He retired.
  - Where?
  - Upstate.
  - Upstate where?
  - Atascadero.
  - That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
- - I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
  - Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should
    talk about this at all, or maybe just...
  - Take a hike, you mean?
  - I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful
    as Cole.
  - I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
  - Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president
    for a hundred grand?
- - Think about it. Okay?
  - Sure.
- - I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to
    come through?
  - Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock
    over.
  - Things a man isn't supposed to know.
  - You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess
    I just wore myself out.
  - Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
- - Yeah?
  - Open your door.
  - What?  What for?
  - Open it and find out.
- - You -- I don't know.
  - ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so,
    so... Ah!
  - Oh, come here.
- - You were gone for a while.
  - I went out to Delmar.
  - ) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
  - I saw her.
  - She didn't see you, in other words.
  - I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I
    thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called
    a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
  - You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
  - I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable.
    Valuable for us.
  - Running your broker scam, you mean.
  - You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together.
    Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this.
    You won't regret this, Roy.
  - Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
  - But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
  - Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
- - You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
  - Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
- - And hello to you, too.
  - I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker
    there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their
    office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble.
    That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the
    sucker into position --
  - Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
  - What?
  - The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
  - But the setup's there. It's there now.
  - I don't think I need it.
  - You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to
    be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
  - Maybe I like it where I am.
- - Don't I get any say in this?
  - No! Because I --
  - That's what I say.
  - What?
  - What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
  - For Christ's sake, why not?
  - Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before,
    baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else.
    But you don't make it work forever.
  - Bullshit!
  - No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when
    it hits you.
- - What is it? What's going on?
  - I'm happy the way I am.
  - By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
  - ) What?
  - Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
- - What's that?
  - Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go
    back where you been, huh?
- - You watch that mouth.
  - I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How
    is it, huh? How do you like --
- - I didn't teach you that.
  - You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
- - Let me see how you did that one.
  - Scram. Go home.
  - I can't. I just left home.
  - You're too young. You should be in school.
  - I am in school.
- - Where's the five?
  - In your other hand.
- - You heard the shower, didn't you?
  - I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
- - Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
  - It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time,
    I gotta have the money.
  - Joe, you know you'll --
- - Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
  - My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
  - I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
  - This time...
  - We'll work something out, Joe.
- - So what's your story today?
  - They twisted my arm.
  - Only one arm?
- - They knocked out my tooth!
  - Only one tooth?
- - Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
  - I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my
    long-lost son.
  - Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
- - Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
  - Thanks, uh, Lilly.
  - Don't mention it.
  - I guess I owe you my life.
  - You always did.
- - What happened to your hand?
  - Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills,
    I'll take care of them.
  - I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
  - Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over
    everybody's eyes, huh?
  - What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
  - Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling
    job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
  - It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
  - And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
- - I like those.
  - You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all
    a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle,
    and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
  - You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
  - That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if
    you --
  - How come?
- - Not as tough as you, huh?
  - No. And you have to be.
- - Up to you.
  - My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too
    much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the
    only way to get the odds down.
  - Sure.
  - The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have
    been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to
    see how you were gonna be.
- - That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work
    out.
  - Bluebell came in?
  - I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets.
    I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
- - Lucky? You call that lucky?
  - He let me live. He let me be his friend.
- - You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
  - You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in
    the stomach, Roy?
- - I tripped over a chair.
  - Get off the grift, Roy.
  - Why?
  - You don't have the stomach for it.
- - I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
  - That's right.
- - Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
  - Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
- - If you come out to the track, don't know me.
  - We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
- - What's that?
  - Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
  - Roy, I don't want money from you.
  - I pay my debts.
  - You do?
- - Expecting visitors?
  - No. That was the point.
- - You ought to put a bandage on that.
  - No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the
    air.
- - I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
  - I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
  - After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
  - Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
  - You, too, Roy.
- - Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't
    be a home-cooked meal, you know.
  - Well, that's good news.
- - Going somewhere?
  - Somewhere else, that's for sure.
  - I just came back from Phoenix.
  - Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
  - Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
  - I've really got to --
  - You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
  - Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
  - Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
  - Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
  - Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
- - Myra followed you, huh?
  - She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running.
    Did you tell her about my stash?
  - No.
  - No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
  - I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
  - As though you do what I say.
  - That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
- - I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and
    the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
  - This way's perfect.
- - It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out
    of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
  - You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
- - I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
  - Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
- - I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
  - You must have some money.
  - Just a few bucks.
  - And Myra's stuff?
  - Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
  - Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
  - At what?
  - You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding
    a job.
  - A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
  - Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a
    quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys
    will be all over you.
  - Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
  - Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
  - What?
  - I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now
    --
  - Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
  - I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
  - Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm
    a survivor, Roy. I survive.
  - I know you do, so that's why --
  - And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so
    I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
  - No.
- - You want a drink?
  - I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
  - No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
  - Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
  - I'll get it.
- - You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
  - Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
- - I know what's bugging you, of course.
  - Oh? I didn't know anything was.
  - Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't
    a very good mother when you were a kid.
  - Not very good!
- - A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side,
    since then. I know just how bad I was.
  - Uh-huh.
  - I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
  - Never.
  - No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same
    time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I
    was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
- - What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of
    that yourself.
  - And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know,
    the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
  - For God's sake, Lilly!
  - I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
  - No.
- - You're getting off the grift?
  - That's right.
  - That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
  - I don't?
  - If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
  - I don't see why not.
  - Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your
    age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
- - Well, uh...
  - Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
  - Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
  - And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll
    just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into
    the game.
  - Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of
    you, Lilly.
- - If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've
    got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like
    a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
  - A future. The only future I've got.
  - That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part
    of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your
    hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when
    you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
  - ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the
    power.
  - Just trying to help, Lilly.
- - Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
  - What?
- - There's nothing more to talk about.
  - I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
- - Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
  - Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
  - NO!
- - Whadaya say?
  - Hello.
- - Kaggs. Home office.
  - Roy Dillon.
  - I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't
    saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
- - What's up?
  - That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things
    like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
  - You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
  - Lead on.
- - When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us.
    I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man,
    but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half
    asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs,
    incidentally.
  - So I heard.
  - Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good
    money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have
    them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
  - Just myself.
  - That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager.
    Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have
    a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
- - Sounds like a good Idea.
  - I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is,
    we'll top it by fifteen percent.
- - What? Me?
  - That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second
    year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
  - Well, uh... No.
  - No?
  - I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating,
    I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
  - I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready?
    A week?
  - But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
  - I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long,
    they can go a little longer.
  - Well...
- - See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
  - Oh, sure. Fine.
- - And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
  - Perk.
- - Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
  - Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
  - You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
  - I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
  - Oh, come on, Roy.
  - The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
  - Perk, remember?
  - Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own
    hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
  - A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something
    you care about, something you can think about.
  - Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
  - Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose
    you as a salesman, too.
  - Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
  - That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else,
    I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
  - Fair enough.
- - Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
  - Why? What's wrong?
  - You are a valued customer, as you know.
  - But what's wrong?
  - I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
  - What is?
  - This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones,
    no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
  - But they must be! They cut glass!
  - Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
- - It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
  - Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
- - All right.
  - I'll get you a check.
- - I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
  - It's not your fault.
  - You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything
    you think we might be interested in...
  - I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
  - Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
  - You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
- - Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
  - Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
  - Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly,
    you don't argue with Bobo.
  - I know.
  - Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
  - Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
- - The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
  - What? He's going to be all right!
  - Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage,
    he's bleeding to death inside.
  - Well, make it stop!
  - His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the
    hospital.
  - You know who I work for.
- - Yes, yes, but that's --
  - My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
- - Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
  - And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
  - I certainly hope not.
  - Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
  - I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
- - The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There
    isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to
    wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is,
    Mister Hebbing?
  - One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
  - You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New
    York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay
    in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
- - Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
  - Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to
    take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York
    before the Tokyo data comes in.
  - Not much time.
  - We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information
    means, and we have to move immediately.
  - Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
  - These machines -- They're in here.
- - Here you are! Two rich people!
  - I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
  - You brought a case? Good.
- - Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
  - Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money
    for your special clients!
  - Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
  - Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing
    with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
- - Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
  - Goody!
- - Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
  - Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
  - Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister
    Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses.
    If he could...
- - Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
  - So here we are!
  - Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure
    you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
- - Want a look?
  - Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
- - Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
  - We're not really interested, Henry.
- - You ruined me! You destroyed me!
  - Henry, no!
- - Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
  - Can't move.
  - It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
  - It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
- - Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
  - Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
- - Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
  - Roy? He's always crying.
  - The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
  - I like you, too.
- - Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
  - Hah.
- - Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
  - Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
  - Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
- - I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
  - Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
  - Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
- - I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
  - Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
  - Right in front of the room.
  - Fine.
- - And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
  - No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
- - Hi, Bobo.
  - Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
- - Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
  - You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the
    Durando.
- - How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
  - I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
  - You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that
    nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
  - I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was
    a lot of action on those--
- - One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your
    teeth?
  - I want to keep my teeth.
  - Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid
    off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board
    from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote,
    but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some
    mark you can blow off!
  - Bobo, no, I --
  - You wanna talk to me straight up?
  - My son --
  - Your what?
  - My son was in the hospital --
  - What the fuck are you doin with a son?
  - He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real
    sick.
  - Motherhood.
  - I never fucked up before, Bobo.
  - You expect me to buy this?
- - I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
  - It'll never happen again. I swear.
  - It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
- - You're calling the shots.
  - You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your
    clothes?
  - No.
  - I'll loan you a raincoat.
- - You ever hear about the oranges?
  - You mean, the insurance frammis?
  - Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
- - You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises,
    but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams
    against insurance companies.
  - And if you do it wrong?
  - It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
  - What's that, Lilly?
- - Permanent damage.
  - You'll never shit right again.
- - Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
  - Oh, thanks, Bobo.
  - You want a drink?
  - Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
  - See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
- - He's a good kid. A salesman.
  - On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
- - Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
  - Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
  - That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
  - A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else.
    He's a liability, right, Bobo?
  - You're a thousand percent right!
  - Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
  - You know it, Lilly.
  - You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it
    somehow makes you look taller.
  - Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
  - Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder
    where I am.
  - Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
  - I will. So long, Bobo.
- - Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
  - Have I kept you waiting?
  - Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
  - No news yet?
  - No. No word.
  - Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
  - I know -- I know.
  - I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach
    the matter ---
- - No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
  - Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic.
    You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
  - Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid
    basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father
    -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily
    otherwise.
  - Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people
    must go through.
  - I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like
    to have things down before me in black and white.
  - I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right,
    Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
  - Good night.
- - Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
  - Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen
    -- will you clear up the situation?
  - But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
- - I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
  - Well -- gentlemen.
- - Next week.
  - You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time.
    Why?
- - What's the matter with you?
  - Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
  - What's bluff?
  - That.
  - '''Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I''d never have thought
    it of you.'
  - No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well,
    if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone.
    From now on...
  - You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
  - Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort
    of thing goes to a man's head.
  - What you need is some relaxation.
  - Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like
    to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
  - I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
  - Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever...
    Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
  - What do you want with her?
  - I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for
    my father-in-law.
  - She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
  - Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
  - Pretty as a picture.
  - Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't
    know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
  - Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
- - We will wait.
  - You are late. Hurry.
- - How is the house?
  - Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
  - If the house is empty again, I don't know --
  - When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know
    these people.
- - What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
  - The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal
    in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
- - Four minutes past. Please come.
  - Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
  - Madam Grusinskaya's car.
- - If you will wait one moment, sir.
  - I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all
    and what a room that is.
  - It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
  - Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a
    cheap room? Did I?
- - Just one moment, sir.
  - No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
- - The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
  - I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
- - I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
  - I don't know you.
  - Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building
    C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
- - Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
  - I could not think of not accepting.
  - You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin,
    indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much
    beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look
    into your books.
- - Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
  - Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
  - You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
  - Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
  - What is this insolence?
  - Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You
    think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
  - Go away -- go away.
- - Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
  - An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of
    this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if
    I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
  - You're discharged.
  - Me?
  - Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
- - Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
  - He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
  - My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
  - -- We must do something...
  - Yes, the police must be called.
  - No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
  - Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
  - Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
  - Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
  - I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that
    girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
  - Yes, I know them --
  - The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady
    upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give
    you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
  - We must call the police, your excellency.
- - How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
  - Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There
    has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
- - Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive
    rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
  - Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
  - Certainly, sir.
  - Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the
    front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
- - Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
  - Again?
  - Please.
- - It is time for the performance.
  - The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
- - It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
  - What -- what is it? Last night...
  - Last night?... There was no applause.
  - There was -- there was.
  - That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished
    -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't
    come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed,
    Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
- - Good morning, Pimenov.
  - Good morning, Gru -- your --
- - Gru -- you are positively radiant.
  - Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
- - He will be on the train.
  - But when did he go? How do you know?
- - What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like
    a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten
    there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?...
    Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
  - I'm cancelling the engagement.
  - Oh!
- - Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such
    a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front
    of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
  - The house is not full -- Is it really full?
  - Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French
    Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
  - Oh -- but it can't be.
- - Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
  - Why not?
  - Take them back, Suzette.
  - You haven't time.
- - Hurry, Suzette.
  - Such nonsense.
- - I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
  - I wish to be alone.
  - You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
- - Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
  - Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
- - Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
  - Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
  - I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
- - Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I
    think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help
    me to sleep.
  - Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
- - I can't dance tonight --
  - It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
  - Let us cancel the engagement.
  - But, Madam. cannot do that.
  - Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me --
    enough -- enough.
- - Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
  - The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate
    them!
- - Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same
    young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier
    -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night
    for instance --
  - Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
- - Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
  - Send it away -- I shan't need it.
- - Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
  - All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
- - Good morning, Suzette.
  - Good morning, Madam.
- - Madam has slept well?
  - Oh, yes, Suzette.
  - Madam will dress now, it is late.
  - Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
  - Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
- - Madam should sleep.
  - I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
  - When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
  - In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels
    and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet
    -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
  - Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
  - Goodnight, Suzette.
- - Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
  - Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
- - Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
  - He likes to play the great man.
- - Shall I tell them again?
  - Why waste time -- it's getting late.
  - You see -- what we are interested in --
  - Ah, come on -- we're going home.
- - You're a deep one.
  - In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
- - How clear is Manchester?
  - Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester,
    Mr. Preysing?
- - Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for
    a merger...
  - Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
  - As you remember it -- when you approached us...
  - We did not approach you.
- - '...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready
    for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why
    should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?'
  - I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What
    reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil
    days.
- - Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
  - You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
- - Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
  - What a session this has been.
- - What?
  - They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
  - Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the
    beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
- - There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've
    the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with --
    Manchester?
  - We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
  - I mean with the Manchester people?
  - We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time.
    We must begin at the beginning.
  - All right.
  - Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a
    merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully
    agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
- - Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
  - I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital,
    plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop
    rags --
  - Mop rags --!
- - I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
  - Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
  - No water -- What a place!
  - All you have to do is phone for it.
- - Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so
    obvious...
  - Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what
    your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth
    it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
  - We did not approach you.
- - Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately
    and scratched at my door.
  - Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
  - Of course you took the initiative.
- - I know you did -- I said you did --
  - And I said we didn't.
- - Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone,
    sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
  - Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
  - What?
- - Sorry, Preysing.
  - You've decided against the merger?
  - Yes --
  - Then, it's all over?
  - Yes --
- - Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such
    a crisis. We've...
  - Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations.
    You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but
    Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that
    I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.
  - What?
  - Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.
  - If you actually have news from Manchester then...
  - Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and
    the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
  - Preysing, you're joking with us.
- - I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
  - Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
  - Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
- - See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
  - Next week.
- - And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
  - Exactly.
  - If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with
    the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have
    to declare himself.
  - Shhh -- here he is now.
- - Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be
    very simple.
  - Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't
    it?
- - What we want to know about is Manchester.
  - Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
- - What...! --
  - I'm the stenographer.
  - Then you will please wait outside.
- - Moreover --
  - Moreover --
- - Moreover...
  - Moreover...
- - Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
  - No -- only occasional jobs.
  - Tired?
  - You pay me.
  - You're a very unusual stenographer --
  - Moreover...
  - Moreover...
- - I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her
    work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in
    offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
  - Movies?
  - Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
- - What is this?
  - I got ten marks for that.
- - You...
  - Me.
- - You...
  - Moreover...
  - What?
  - Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
  - What brown hands you have.
  - That's from skiing.
  - Skiing?
  - Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
- - A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
  - Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
- - Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
  - Perhaps.
- - Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
  - Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
  - With the same friend?
- - No.
  - Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending
    with the Manchester Cotton Company...
  - Not too quickly.
  - What?
  - You're a little too fast.
  - Can't you understand me?
  - I understand you perfectly.
  - Have you got it now?
  - Cotton Company --
  - Should throw a great weight into the balance...
  - '...weight into the balance...'
- - How nice -- your daughters?
  - My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
  - Is that Mrs. Preysing.
  - Definitely off.
  - Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
  - That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.
- - Miss Flaemm.
  - Hello!
  - I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
  - Presently, Mr. Preysing.
  - It's urgent.
- - Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
  - I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
  - Tomorrow morning.
  - No -- now.
  - Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von
    Gaigern.
- - Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
  - I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
- - Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
  - Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
  - Nothing.
- - I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets
    the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
  - Well -- you want me?
  - Yes.
  - Well?
  - I must go to England -- at once.
  - Well?
  - You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm
    -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't
    know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen --
    and I mean --
  - I understand perfectly.
  - What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
  - Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold
    in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
  - Of course -- of course.
  - A thousand marks --
  - It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
- - Can you pay some attention to me?
  - Oh, yes.
  - Insolent young cub!
  - You mean Baron von Gaigern?
  - Baron!
  - Well, he's a gentleman!
- - You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
  - I had to arrange about the trip.
  - You're sweet.
  - You think so?
- - Come here.
  - Here, hold up!
- - Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
  - Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
  - Oh, no.
  - Why not?
  - I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
  - You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
  - 'It''s not funny at all. One can''t get intimate just off hand. I could go to
    England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and
    I said: ''How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  ''That was the young lady
    who was my secretary in Manchester''.'
- - If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered
    champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
  - Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but
    that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
  - Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
- - You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they
    mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing
    life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
  - You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
  - Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
- - I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you
    think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And
    these are real silk drapes.
  - Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
  - Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get
    a bath whenever I like.
- - Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
  - Oh, don't go.
  - I'm engaged for the evening.
  - Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
  - To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
- - Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
  - I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred
    miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
  - Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
  - Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm,
    won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
  - No - absinthe.
  - Yes -- that --
- - You like music?
  - Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
  - A man might what?
  - I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
  - Oh -- you would!
- - Dance then?
  - She's beautiful -- isn't she?
- - You must look at my face and not at the floor.
  - Yes.
  - You're trembling.
  - I never danced before -- in public.
  - You dance splendidly.
  - I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
  - Really?
  - For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
- - Please -- please!
  - You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
- - Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
  - Oh -- what -- what --
- - Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
  - Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing
    --
  - Preysing?
- - What's the matter?
  - Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
  - You loved the Baron, didn't you?
  - Yes --
  - So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
  - Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
  - He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed
    -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
  - I didn't like Preysing right off.
  - Then why did you have anything to do with him?
  - Money!
  - Yes, of course, -- money!
  - You don't understand that do you?
  - Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending
    it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come
    to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
  - What?
  - You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand
    two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will
    last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
  - Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
  - Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred.
    Later you can have more.
  - Later?
  - When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will
    you stay with me until...
  - Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these
    days.
  - Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
  - Oh yes, of course.
  - Do you like me better?
  - You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
- - Am I!
  - Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
- - How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
  - Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
- - I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room --
    a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as
    Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room,
    way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
  - This gentleman can have my room.
  - Oh!
  - Send his bags up to my room.
  - Oh -- but -- I --
  - You're tired. I can see that.
  - Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
  - You are ill.
- - I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he
    is ill.
  - Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
- - You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
  - I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
- - Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
  - The Grand Hotel.
  - Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the
    shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
  - Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
  - But Doctor --
- - Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
  - Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk --
    feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk,
    too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before.
    The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me
    as the Baron.
- - No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
  - Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
- - Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
  - For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
- - Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
  - What, Doctor?
  - A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
  - I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be
    able to dance, it seems to be very important.
  - You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a
    man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
  - Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone
    in the world.
  - I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
  - Everything?
  - I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner.
    Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade
    in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two
    years.  I've been everything.
- - Excuse me, gentlemen.
  - I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
- - Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
  - Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
  - I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
- - There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
  - More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
  - Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen
    thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
- - Oh, I've got to find it.
  - Stay where you are.
  - No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
- - You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
  - No.
- - Any letters?
  - No, Doctor.
  - Telegrams?
  - No, Doctor.
  - Anyone asked for me?
  - Nobody, Doctor.
- - Any letters?
  - No, doctor.
- - Is that for me?
  - No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
  - Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
- - For me?
  - No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
  - Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
- - For me?
  - No -- letters to two-eighty.
  - If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
- - The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
  - Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
- - Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
  - Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
- - The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
  - Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what
    my wife suffered.
  - And the child isn't coming?
  - No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
  - News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
  - What? -- Who? -- Whom?
  - The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
  - Good heavens. What for?
  - I don't know.
  - Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
  - It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
  - I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I
    can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and
    now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about
    the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such
    an agreeable fellow.
  - Most imposters are --
- - Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
  - Insolent -- Berlin manners.
- - Oh, let the poor devil alone.
  - I did not ask your advice.
- - I think it would be much better if you went away.
  - We shall see who remains here the longer.
  - As you will.
- - Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
  - I must have made a mistake.
  - Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay
    here... Give me that money.
- - So that's how we stand, Baron.
  - Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter
    of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
  - Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron,
    you're a thief.
  - Be quiet.
  - I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with
    the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
- - Hello! Hello! --
  - Don't do that.
- - Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
  - Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
  - Oh -- good evening, Baron.
  - How's the beautiful lady?
  - Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous.
    Were you at the theatre last night?
  - Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
  - Well -- last night was not so good.
  - I thought she was splendid!
  - Yes -- but the audience.
- - It's always so quiet here.
  - If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet
    of a hotel lobby.
  - My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
  - No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm
    her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there
    you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
- - The war.
  - That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
  - Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
  - The war dropped him here and forgot him.
  - Yes, I was in the war.
- - Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
  - Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
- - Thank you, sir.
  - Not at all, sir.
  - Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
  - I'm Baron von Gaigern.
  - Oh, a Baron!
- - And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
  - Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
- - What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
  - General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as
    an office boy in that man's factory --
  - Then you know him?
  - Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
- - Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
  - Yes, quite.
  - We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
- - I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
  - In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
  - Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
- - Hello -- sorry I'm late.
  - Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
  - Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
  - A little strange, Baron.
- - A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
  - No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
- - The Baron is tired?
  - No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
  - Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed
    with the marvelous bright lights?
  - I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
  - Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
- - Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
  - Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
  - If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
- - What?
  - I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
  - If I could get into a game I might win some.
  - Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
  - If we could scare up some men to play.
  - We could come to my room.
  - Good!
- - Ready, Kringelein?
  - Ready, Baron.
- - Is that too much, Baron?
  - No -- not at all.
  - All right then.
  - All right then.
- - That was my last.
  - You've lost everything?
  - I've no luck.
  - Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
- - Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
  - I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along,
    Baron.
- - I take five hundred.
  - All of that at once, Baron?
- - Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
  - Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
  - Goodnight, Kringelein.
  - No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
- - You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
  - Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
- - Please do not be frightened, Madam.
  - What do you want here?
  - Nothing -- only to be here.
  - Why do you hide in my room?
  - But surely you must know -- because I love you.
  - Because you love me -- you love me?
- - Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
  - I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No.
    I am not afraid. It is strange.
  - Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
  - Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very
    tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
  - I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
- - So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
  - I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
  - Certainly.
- - Why do you look at me like that?
  - I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
  - And then --?
  - No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in
    my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
  - And -- and --
  - How tired you are!
  - Yes -- tired...
  - So alone.
  - Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
  - You mustn't talk Russian to me.
  - Strange man...
  - Am I quite strange to you?
  - Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when
    the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
  - And...?
  - He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
  - I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
  - Go away. Who are you --?
  - A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
  - You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved
    me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How
    is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love
    me?
  - I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror --
    Grusinskaya...
  - Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya --
    for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is
    she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases
    -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
  - Yes -- I do understand.
  - I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
  - I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
  - I want to be alone.
  - That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
  - I want to be alone --
  - No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I
    left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't
    cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
  - Just for a minute then.
- - The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline
    means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know
    what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
  - I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
- - I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming
    into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto
    a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
  - I should like to smoke.
- - Why do you smile?
  - Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
  - What can you see?
  - You are beautiful!
  - No.
  - Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's
    bedroom.
- - I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you
    alone here? After that --?
  - What?
  - The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
  - I want to be alone.
  - That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being
    alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I
    go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
- - Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping.
    We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial
    Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty
    machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous
    is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you
    at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
  - I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
  - Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
  - I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
  - Really?
  - Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
  - No?
  - When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school,
    it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
  - And?
  - And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
  - And what do you do -- now?
  - I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of
    life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
  - Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
  - I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
  - That's a silly joke.
  - Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you --
    that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
  - What is the matter?
- - There.
  - Oh --
- - You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present
    of them.
  - I don't want them now.
  - I'll not denounce you.
  - I know.
  - So --
  - Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
  - But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
  - I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls.
    I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've
    been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think
    about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and
    now.
  - And now?
  - I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
- - Do you understand?
  - Yes -- yes -- yes.
- - Grusinskaya --
  - Yes.
  - You do believe that I really love you?
  - Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
  - I want to be good to you -- madly good.
  - Suzette will be back here in a minute.
  - I'll go -- good-bye.
  - Shall I see you again?
  - I --
- - Suzette will be back here any minute.
  - When are you leaving Berlin?
  - Very early in the morning.
  - For Vienna?
  - Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for
    us -- for us both.
  - Oh -- yes but -- later.
  - Why later?
  - I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
  - I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
  - Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage
    myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
  - Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
  - Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
- - You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
  - I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
- - Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
  - Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
- - Bless you...
  - Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance
    -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
  - I can't.
  - No?
  - No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
  - Why do you think --
  - Why?
  - They've brought me such good luck -- you --
- - I'm worried about you.
  - Don't.
  - On the train?
  - Yes -- I will be on the train.
  - Till then.
  - Bless you --
- - Like dancing?
  - Not with strangers.
- - Never?
  - You're a fool!
  - Yes, I am rather.
- - He must be very nice.
  - Who?
  - Whoever is keeping you waiting.
  - Have you seen it?
  - Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
  - That.
  - You?
  - Oh -- work!!
  - Oh!
  - Dictation.  You know...
  - Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but
    --
  - Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
  - Reducing?
  - No -- why? -- should I?
  - Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
  - Money -- Ever heard of it?
  - Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers
    earn little pennies?
  - Very little.
  - Too bad.
  - Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought
    herself?
  - Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
  - Aren't you?
  - What?
  - Free --
  - Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
  - Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
  - Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
  - Where downstairs?
  - Yellow Room where they dance --
  - You're very funny --
  - Yes? -- Tomorrow?
  - Of course.
  - Really?
- - We'll dance.
  - All right. We'll dance.
- - I'd given you up.
  - Sorry.
- - Chasing around.
  - Chasing what?
  - Money.
- - You were very different yesterday.
  - Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
- - That was lovely.
  - Will you do me a big favor?
  - I'll do anything for you.
  - Would you like to make a man happy?
  - Yes -- I'd love to.
  - Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
  - Why?
  - I feel sorry for him.
  - You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
  - I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
  - Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
  - I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
  - Anything for you.
- - Going?
  - Yes --
- - Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
  - Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
  - You live here?
  - For tonight.
  - Oh!
  - Yes -- oh!
  - Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
  - And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
- - Have you a minute now?
  - No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
  - Time's getting short.
  - I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
- - I want to speak --
  - Not now.
  - Yes, sir.
- - You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
  - Well?
  - She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
  - Yes.
  - And what are you going to do?
  - The pearls are in her room.
  - Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone
    to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
  - I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
  - You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the
    trouble with you.
  - I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
  - Need any help?
  - No.
  - Have you got that skeleton key?
- - No --
  - Why?
  - The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
  - I could take care of her.
  - How?
  - Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
  - No -- no -- no -- no...
  - Why?
  - Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it
    in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
  - You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
  - I don't like your tone.
  - No --
- - Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
  - With the pearls?
  - With the pearls --
- - I've quit.
  - You can't.
  - I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
  - What about the money?
  - I'll pay you back.
  - How?
  - I have an idea working in my head...
  - You might find a bullet through that head...
  - If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait --
    I'll give you your six thousand back --
- - Turn 'em up.
  - Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --
- - I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
  - Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
- - I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous.
    The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen,
    but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
  - Splendid!
- - Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it,
    then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy
    and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does
    a man know anything about life.
  - Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
- - It's a short life and a gay one...
  - Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life
    -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last
    night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the
    --
- - Is anything wrong?
  - No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
- - The Carlsons' are here.
  - They are?  Come on.
- - They came all the way from Tarzana.
  - It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
- - What's happening?
  - Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
  - I don't believe it.
  - That what he says. Right?
- - Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
  - Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
- - Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
  - Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing
    some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning
    --
- - I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
  - I'd like to discuss this.
  - This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as
    a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
- - -- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
  - Dad -- can you listen --
  - I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of
    what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better
    work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
- - Hello.
  - Mrs. Robinson?
  - Yes?
  - It's Benjamin.
  - Yes?
  - Benjamin Braddock.
  - Benjamin -- where are you?
  - Can you look through the glass.
- - Can you see me now?
  - Yes, I can.
- - I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I --
    I drove her home.
  - Swell. I appreciate it.
  - She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
  - Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
  - Yes, sir.
- - Here. It looks like you need a refill.
  - Oh no.
  - What?
  - I've got to go.
  - Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
  - No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little
    upset about my future.
- - Thank you very much, sir.
  - Ben -- how old are you now?
  - Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
  - That's a hell of a good age to be.
  - Thank you.
  - I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
  - Sir?
  - You'll never be young again.
  - I know.
  - Ben, can I say something to you?
  - What?
  - How long have we known each other now?
- - How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
  - Quite a while.
  - I've watched you grow up, Ben.
  - Yes, sir.
  - In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
  - Thank you.
  - So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
  - I'd like to hear it.
  - Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now
    than you seem to.
- - You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
  - Oh no.
  - What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look
    to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
- - Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
  - Oh yes.
  - Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
  - I will.
  - Great.
- - Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
  - Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
  - That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming
    down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
  - I will.
  - Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
- - Hello.
  - What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
  - Yes.
- - Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
  - Mr. Robinson?
  - Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment
    for me?
  - No, it's not --
  - Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things
    I stand for that you despise?
  - It was nothing to do with you, sir.
  - Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
- - Now look -- please --
  - Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to
    threaten each other?
  - I am not threatening you.
  - Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark,
    you know. I've been here quite a while.
  - I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I
    am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
  - You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
  - No, I don't.
  - Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think
    you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know
    that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
  - But why?
  - Why?
  - It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
  - That's quite a statement.
  - Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It
    was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
  - Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
  - You miss the point.
  - Don't shout at me, Ben.
  - The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
  - Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine
    I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
  - HUH?
  - I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't
    know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's
    happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter
    again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
- - I'm just --
  - -- worried?
  - Well --
  - About what?
  - I guess -- about my future.
  - What about it?
  - I don't know. I want it to be --
  - To be what?
  - Different.
- - Why?
  - Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
  - Have you thought about graduate school?
  - No.
  - Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What
    was the point of all that hard work?
  - You got me.
  - Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's
    done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and
    lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person
    would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think
    about getting off his ass.
- - I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
  - Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
  - How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings,
    whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
  - That has nothing to do with it --
  - I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening --
    doing God knows what --
- - Say that again.
  - I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
- - Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
  - No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
- - Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
  - No. She doesn't know about it.
  - She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
  - No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
- - Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
  - No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
- - Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
  - Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
- - Can I talk to you a minute?
  - Sure.
  - Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you
    don't want.
  - What?
  - Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
  - When I go off?
  - You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
  - No, I do. I want to tell you.
- - I drive around.
  - What else?
  - Nothing else.
  - Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
  - Oh, no.
  - Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
  - Meet someone?
- - Why did you say that?
  - Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
  - No wait. Wait.
- - I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
  - Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say
    anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
  - Well, wait.
- - Well why do you -- why do you think that?
  - Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
  - Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
  - Not if you don't want to.
  - I do.
  - But I don't want you to make up something.
  - I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk.
    I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk.
    Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean
    it kind of scares me to drive home after --
  - Goodnight, Benjamin.
  - You believe me, don't you?
  - No.
  - You don't?
- - But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
  - Goodnight.
- - It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's
    awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
  - Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her
    up in my life.
- - Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
  - I do.
  - -- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
- - I'm going up to Berkeley today.
  - Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
- - They don't know?
  - No -- they don't.
  - Well -- when did you decide all this?
  - About an hour ago.
- - When did you two talk this over?
  - We haven't.
- - No -- actually I'm not --
  - I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
- - Braddock -- Braddock?
  - Yes, but I'm afraid --
  - I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
  - No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
  - I'm afraid I don't understand.
  - I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
  - Hey -- I don't get it.
- - I say I've got it.
  - Sir?
  - The toothbrush. I got it all right.
  - Very good, sir.
  - Yes. Well -- goodnight.
  - Goodnight, sir.
- - Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
  - It's down the hall.
- - How are you, Benjamin?
  - Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
- - Is there an ashtray in here?
  - No.
  - Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
- - Is it a girl?
  - Is what a girl?
  - Whatever it is you're upset about.
  - Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
  - In general.
  - That's right.
- - Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
  - What?
  - Will you take me home?
  - What?
  - My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
- - You don't?
  - No.
  - Let's go.
- - Thank you.
  - Right.
- - Will you come in, please?
  - What?
  - I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
  - What for?
  - Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
- - Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming
    into a dark house.
  - But it's light in there now.
  - Please.
- - What do you drink? Bourbon?
  - Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind.
    Can you understand that?
- - All right then.
  - What do you drink?
- - Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
  - Why not?
  - Please wait till my husband gets home.
  - When is he coming back?
  - I don't know.
- - Drink?
  - No.
- - Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
  - Yes.
  - Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
  - I'm very neurotic.
- - What do you think of me?
  - What do you mean?
  - You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
  - Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
  - Did you know I was an alcoholic?
  - What?
  - Did you know that?
  - Look -- I think I should be going --
  - Sit down, Benjamin.
  - Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting
    a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
  - No.
  - What?
  - My husband will be back quite late.
- - Oh my God.
  - Pardon?
  - Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
  - What's wrong?
  - Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
  - What?
  - I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
  - Like what?
  - What do you think?
  - Well I don't know.
  - For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You
    give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life
    to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
  - So?
  - Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
- - Aren't you?
  - Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
  - Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
  - It's all right.
  - It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
  - Sit down.
  - Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm
    mixed up.
  - All right. Now finish your drink.
  - Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
  - We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
  - What is wrong with me?
  - Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
  - Her portrait?
  - Yes.
  - No.
  - We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
  - Very much.
- - I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
  - Benjamin?
  - Yes?
  - Will you unzip my dress?
- - I think I'll go to bed.
  - Oh. Well, goodnight.
  - Won't you unzip my dress?
  - I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
  - If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
  - No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
  - Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
  - I know that. But I'm --
  - Come on.
- - Thank you.
  - Right.
- - What are you so scared of?
  - I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
  - Then why do you keep running away?
  - Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
- - Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
  - Yes, I have --
- - But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
  - What if he did?
  - Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
  - Don't you think he trusts us together?
  - Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
  - I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
  - But they would! Don't you see?
  - Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
  - I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
  - Why is it?
  - Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell
    what's real. I can't --
  - Would you like me to seduce you?
  - What?
  - Is that what you're trying to tell me?
  - I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But
    I'm going home right now.
- - I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
  - Where is it?
  - On that chair in the hall.
- - Don't be nervous.
  - Get away from that door.
  - I want to say something first.
  - Jesus Christ!
  - Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me
    this time --
  - Oh my God.
  - If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call
    me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
  - Let me out!
  - Do you understand what I said?
  - Yes. Yes. Let me out!
  - Because I find you very attractive and any time --
- - Yes, I do.
  - I've got to go.
- - Benjamin?
  - Yes.
  - Thank you for taking me home.
- - Hello, Benjamin.
  - Oh. Hello. Hello.
- - May I sit down?
  - Of course.
- - How are you?
  - Very well. Thank you.
- - May I have a drink?
  - A drink? Of course.
- - He didn't see me.
  - Waiter!
- - You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
  - Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave
    when you're --
- - Did you get us a room?
  - What?
  - Have you gotten us a room yet?
  - I haven't. No.
  - Do you want to?
  - Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
  - Do you want me to get it?
  - You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
  - Do you want to get it now?
  - Now?
  - Yes.
  - Well -- I don't know.
  - Why don't you get it.
  - Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
- - I got a single room.
  - That's fine.
  - But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I
    mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
  - Well -- do you want to go up first?
  - Yes -- I think that would be good.
  - I'll be up in five minutes.
  - Well -- goodbye then --
  - Benjamin.
  - Yes?
  - Isn't there something you want to tell me?
  - To tell you?
  - Yes.
  - Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
  - The number.
  - What?
  - The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
  - Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
  - Thank you.
  - You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
- - Well.
  - Benjamin.
  - Yes?
  - I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
  - Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you
    want me to do.
  - Why don't you watch?
  - Oh -- sure. Thank you.
- - Will you bring me a hanger?
  - What?
  - A hanger.
- - Oh -- yes. Wood?
  - What?
  - Wood or wire? They have both.
  - Either one will be fine.
  - Okay.
- - Thank you.
  - You're welcome.
- - Would this be easier for you in the dark?
  - Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
  - You what?
  - This is all terribly wrong.
  - Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
  - Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my
    parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
  - Are you afraid of me?
  - No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson --
    would you like to go to a movie.
  - Benjamin, is this your first time?
  - Is this -- what?
  - It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
  - That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
  - You can admit that, can't you?
  - Are you kidding?
  - It's nothing to be ashamed of --
  - Wait a minute!
  - On your first time --
  - Who said it was my first time?
  - That you're afraid --
  - Wait a minute.
  - -- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in
    one way --
  - INADEQUATE!
- - Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
  - If you want.
  - Good. I mean are we dead or something?
  - Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
  - All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
  - Are you tired of it?
  - I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
  - Well what do you want to talk about?
  - Anything. Anything at all.
  - Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
  - Oh my God.
  - Well?
  - Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes
    off and --
- - Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation.
    Think of another topic.
  - How about art.
  - Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
  - You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
  - Oh.
  - Don't you?
  - Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
  - Go ahead then.
  - Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
- - Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
  - Neither.
  - You're not interested in art?
  - No.
  - Then why do you want to talk about it?
  - I don't.
- - Can I take off my clothes now?
  - No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
  - Do you really want me to?
  - Yes I do.
  - I got up.
- - Do you want to hear it or not?
  - Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
  - I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
  - What one.
  - What?
  - What novel did you read.
  - I don't remember.
- - Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
  - There!
  - What?
  - Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
  - Him?
  - I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I
    don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
  - There isn't any.
  - There's no risk?
- - How do you get out of the house?
  - I walk out.
  - You walk right out the door.
- - What do you say to him?
  - He's asleep.
  - Always?
  - Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
  - Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
  - Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at
    ten o'clock.
  - But what about the noise from the car. What if --
  - The driveway's on my side of the house.
  - We're talking.
  - What?
  - We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
  - Calm down, Benjamin.
  - Now let's keep going here.
  - Can I undress and talk at the same time?
  - Right.
  - Thank you.
  - Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep
    in the same room.
  - We don't.
  - So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't
    sleep together or anything.
  - No we don't.
  - Well how long has this been going on.
  - About five years.
  - Oh no. Are you kidding me?
  - No.
  - You have not slept with your husband for five years?
  - Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
  - How many times a year.
  - On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
  - Man, is this interesting.
  - Is it?
  - So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
  - We've talked enough, Benjamin.
  - Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
  - Not exactly.
  - But you don't hate him.
  - No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
  - Well how do you feel about him, then?
  - I don't.
  - Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
  - Is it?
  - I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least
    you'd hate him.
- - Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
  - No.
  - What?
  - I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
  - Well, wait a minute. You married him.
- - Why did you do that?
  - See if you can guess.
  - Well I can't.
  - Think real hard, Benjamin.
  - I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did
    you?
  - Don't tell Elaine.
  - Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
  - Are you shocked?
  - Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
  - All right. Now let's get to bed.
  - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
  - What?
  - I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
  - Not particularly.
  - Was he a law student at the time?
- - And you were a student also.
  - Yes.
  - At college.
  - Yes.
  - What was your major?
  - Why are you asking me all this?
  - Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
  - Art.
  - Art?
- - But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
  - Kind of.
  - Well how did it happen?
  - How do you think.
  - I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
  - Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
  - I'm curious.
  - We'd go to his car.
  - Oh no. In the car you did it?
  - I don't think we were the first.
- - What kind of car was it?
  - What?
  - Do you remember the make of the car?
  - Oh my God.
  - Really. I want to know.
  - It was a Ford, Benjamin.
  - A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
  - That's enough.
  - So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
- - Don't talk about Elaine.
  - Don't talk about Elaine?
  - No.
  - Why not?
  - Because I don't want you to.
- - I wish you'd tell me.
  - There's nothing to tell.
  - Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
- - Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
  - Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
- - Do you understand that?
  - Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
  - Good.
  - I was just kidding around.
  - Good.
  - But why shouldn't I?
  - I have my reasons.
  - Then let's hear them.
  - No.
  - Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
- - I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even
    talk about her, am I?
  - Let's drop it.
  - We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate,
    aren't I? I'm not fit to --
  - Benjamin?
  - I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's
    it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
  - Yes.
  - You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud
    of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
  - I wouldn't know.
  - Well, I'm not.
  - You're not.
  - No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
  - I see.
  - And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're
    all wrong.
- - Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened
    to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
  - Are you?
  - You're goddamn right I am.
- - That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
  - Now don't start this.
  - What?
  - Don't start acting hurt.
  - Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
  - Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
  - Did I say that?
  - Of course you did.
- - Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
  - Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you
    say you're sorry I got that impression.
  - I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never
    say you weren't as good a person as she is.
  - You wouldn't.
  - Of course I wouldn't.
- - What are you doing?
  - Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
  - Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
  - If that's how you feel --
  - But it's not.
  - That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
  - Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
  - But if it's sickening for you --
  - It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look
    forward to.
  - You don't have to say that.
  - Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
  - May I stay then?
  - Yes. Please. I want you to.
  - Thank you.
  - Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
- - Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her
    out.
  - Then give me your word you won't.
  - This is absurd.
  - Promise me, Benjamin.
  - All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
  - Thank you.  Benjamin --
  - Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
- - Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
  - Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
  - Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because
    it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't
    quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your
    precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
  - But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
- - Drive down the block.
  - Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
  - Do exactly what I say.
- - Now it seems to me --
  - Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever.
    Those are my orders. Is that clear?
- - Mrs. Robinson --
  - I can makes things quite unpleasant.
  - How?
  - In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
  - I don't believe you.
  - Then you'd better start believing me.
  - Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
  - Go home now.
  - I just don't believe you would do that.
- - Hello. Get me the police, please.
  - Where is Elaine?
  - I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve
    hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are
    you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
- - What have you done to her?
  - I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a
    quick drink before you go?
- - You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
  - I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements
    have been so rushed --
  - What the hell have you done?
- - Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
  - I'll find her.
  - I don't think so.
- - Can I help you, sir!
  - What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
- - What?
  - The Singleman party, sir?
  - Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
  - It's in the main ballroom.
  - Ahh -- thank you.
- - Yes sir?
  - A room. I'd like a room, please.
  - A single room or a double room?
  - A single. Just for myself, please.
  - Will you sign the register, please?
- - Is anything wrong, sir?
  - What? No. Nothing.
  - Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
  - Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
  - Where is it?
  - What?
  - Where is your luggage?
  - Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
  - Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
  - Oh no.
  - Sir?
  - I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have
    a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
  - Of course.
- - I'll have a porter show you the room.
  - Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush
    to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
  - Whatever you say, sir.
- - BENJAMIN?
  - Yes.
  - Will you bring up my purse before you go?
  - I have to go now. I'm sorry.
- - Mrs. Robinson?
  - I'm in the bathroom.
  - Well here's the purse.
  - Could you bring it up?
  - Well I'll hand it to you.
- - Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
  - Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't
    do me a simple favor I don't know what.
- - I'm putting it on the top step.
  - For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
- - I'm putting it here by the door.
  - Will you bring it in to me?
  - I'd rather not.
  - All right. Put it in the room where we were.
  - Right.
- - Hello.
  - Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
  - Benjamin?
  - Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
  - Where are you?
  - -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
  - Where are you?
  - Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
  - Did you get a room?
  - No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
  - Give me an hour.
  - What?
  - I'll be there in an hour.
- - You a student?
  - Not exactly.
- - What's that?
  - I said -- not exactly -- no.
  - What are you then?
  - Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
- - I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
  - Ahhh.
- - You're not one of those agitators?
  - What?
  - One of those outside agitators.
  - Oh -- no sir.
  - I hate that. I won't stand for it.
- - Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
  - Who screamed?
  - It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
  - Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
  - It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
- - What did you do to her?
  - Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
- - See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
  - All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll
    have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
  - No, sir.
- - Mr. McCleery?
  - You heard me. Out of here.
  - What for?
  - Because I don't like you.
- - Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
  - I want you out of here.
  - Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's
    sake, will you let me use that phone?
  - I am going to call the police now.
  - Could I make one phone call first?
  - Get out!
- - Ben!
  - Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
  - Ben.
  - Mr. McQuire.
- - Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
  - Yes, sir.
  - Are you listening?
  - Yes I am.
  - Plastics.
- - Exactly how do you mean?
  - There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
  - Yes, I will.
  - Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
- - 657-2036
  - Hello -- who is this?
  - This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
  - Is the doctor anywhere?
  - Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over
    by now. He should be checking in any moment --
  - Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed
    to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten
    what church -- you see?
- - Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's
    on Allan Street.
  - Thank you.
  - I certainly hope you --
- - Hello.
  - Hello.
- - You're living at home now. Is that right?
  - Yes.
  - Do you know what you're going to do?
  - No.
  - Are you going to graduate school?
  - No.
- - Do you always drive like this?
  - Yes.
- - Do you want some dinner?
  - I'd love some.
- - Aren't you eating?
  - No.
  - Why not?
  - If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
- - Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
  - No -- why should I?
  - I don't know.
- - Could you do it?
  - No.
- - Will you take me home now?
  - I'm sorry I took you in there.
  - I think I'd better go home now please.
  - But, Elaine --
  - Where is the car?
  - I just want to tell you something.
- - I want to go home.
  - But could I just tell you this one thing?
  - What?
  - This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced
    me into it.
  - Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
  - No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this.
    I hate myself like this.
- - Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
  - No, I couldn't.
  - But could you try?
  - No.
- - I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion
    that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
  - Yes, I do.
- - Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
  - No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
  - We won't. Let's go inside.
  - Wait a minute.
  - Is anything wrong?
  - No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something
    -- go somewhere else.
  - All right.
- - Where we going?
  - I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
  - Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
- - What is the matter?
  - Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's
    go see if they do or not.
- - Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as
    far as I know.
  - Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
- - Benjamin --
  - Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
  - Benjamin -- do they know you?
  - Of course not.
- - Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
  - I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
- - Do you?
  - Yes.
  - You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first
    person I could stand to be with.
- - I'm sorry. That is not my business.
  - It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else.
    Can you understand that?
- - Was she married or something?
  - Yes.
  - With a family?
  - Yes. She had a husband and a son.
  - Did they ever find out?
  - No.
  - And it's all over now.
  - Yes.
  - I'm glad.
- - All right.
  - During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
  - Okay.
  - You sure you really want to?
  - Yes.
  - Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
  - I do.
  - You do?
  - Benjamin -- I really do.
- - What's the matter?
  - You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
  - Benjamin -- what's happening?
  - Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
- - Why aren't you ready?
  - Because I want to know what's happening.
- - What is it?
  - That woman --
  - What?
  - That woman. The older woman.
  - You mean the one who --
  - Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
- - Elaine --
  - Oh my God --
- - No -- don't cry --
  - GET OUT!
  - Don't cry.
  - Get out of here.
- - I'm meeting someone.
  - Ah. Where?
- - Where are you meeting this person?
  - At the Zoo.
  - The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
  - I've never been to it.
  - Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
- - Is that him over there?
  - No.
  - Where did he say he was going to meet you?
  - I thought he said by the monkey house.
  - Oh.
- - Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
  - Here? In Berkeley?
  - Yes.
  - Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting
    to some classes --
  - But you're not enrolled.
  - No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about
    it.
- - Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
  - Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
  - -- really incredible --
  - Here he comes.
  - What?
  - I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
- - I want to ask you a question.
  - Come in.
  - No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
  - Because -- I am.
  - Is it because I'm here?
  - What do you think?
  - I think it is.
- - I said I think it is.
  - All right then! Yes!
  - Well, I want you to leave.
  - Elaine -- I love you.
  - How could you do that, Benjamin?
- - Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
  - What?
  - I don't understand --
  - Did you say rape her?
  - -- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
  - What did she say?
  - Let me go.
  - You've got to tell me what she said.
- - Why?
  - Because it isn't true.
  - I don't feel well.
- - She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her
    in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would
    get her a room for the night.
  - Then what?
  - Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
  - Elaine -- that is not what happened.
- - Please let me go.
  - All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents.
    I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
- - Don't tell me --
  - -- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and
    --
  - Benjamin -- this is my mother!
  - -- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
- - Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between
    us?
  - Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything
    but I think I'll just do this now.
- - Can I just sit here while you're packing?
  - If you want.
- - What are you looking for?
  - My belt.
  - Don't you have it on?
  - No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's
    from my grandmother.
  - The marble?
  - The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
  - Oh.
- - What are you going to do now?
  - I don't know.
- - Are you going home?
  - No.
  - Well -- where are you going?
- - I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
  - I don't understand.
  - I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
  - But Elaine --
  - Goodbye.
- - Benjamin?
  - What?
  - Will you kiss me!
- - You won't?
  - I don't know.
  - But you might.
  - I might.
  - Is that so? You might marry me?
  - Yes.
  - When?
  - I don't know.
  - How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
  - I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
  - You mean you're confused?
- - Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
  - I don't see how we can.
  - We just can.
  - I have to go back now.
- - Elaine -- are you serious about this?
  - I'll think about it.
  - You really will?
  - Yes.
- - We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
  - Tomorrow?
  - Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
  - Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
  - We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
- - I just don't think it would work.
  - Why wouldn't it?
- - Why wouldn't it?
  - I just don't think it would...
- - Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
  - Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood
    tests.
  - Well -- I have to see Carl first.
  - Carl who?
- - Carl who?
  - Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
  - Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
  - Yes.
  - Why do you have to see him?
  - Well -- I said I might marry him.
- - How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees,
    I hope.
  - No, Benjamin.
  - Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
  - He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
  - Oh no. He said that.
  - Shhhh.
  - Where did he do it?
- - Are we getting married tomorrow?
  - No.
  - The day after tomorrow?
  - Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
- - Benjamin?
  - What?
- - You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your
    crime?
  - I killed too many barbarians.
  - I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give
    our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your
    friend.
- - Who the hell are you?
  - I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I
    am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I
    own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did
    a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually
    get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ...
    my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
  - Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
  - General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is
    nowhere to be seen.
  - Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
- - Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
  - 'You are to be killed, exactly. They''ll give you a sporting chance, but just
    enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter
    with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A
    gladiator at least gets a fair fight.'
  - Death is a very light thing for you.
  - Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker
    with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want
    you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides,
    I've never owned a Roman general before.
- - Take your hands off me animal!
  - Chain him.
- - 'Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won''t even
    get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I
    know what you''re trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition
    of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The
    only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you''re a very important individual.  You
    make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won''t
    even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters
    -- I''ll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.'
  - I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
  - -- to fight?  We'll see...
- - Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to
    have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
  - I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
  - 'Then, you''ll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I''m sorry
    but...'
- - General, do you realize what happened out there today?
  - I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
  - That's one way to look at it.
- - At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small,
    but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some
    very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
  - 'What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii
    Olive Oil?"'
  - Think about it!  Just think about it!
- - General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician
    and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
  - Alive... I'm alive...
- - Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
  - Don't be ridiculous.
- - It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna...
    he was crushed by an elephant.
  - Lucky it didn't step on his head.
- - No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over
    half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man
    who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
  - Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
- - 'Tiger''s challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you
    take a fall.'
  - What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
- - You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of
    pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better
    than the real thing!
  - So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
  - You get to come alive again in the country!
  - As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
  - The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax,
    live the good life!
  - Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better
    wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
  - But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When
    I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
  - Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else
    would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
  - It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest
    of your armor on!
- - 'Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a
    fair fight where would you put your money?'
  - On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever
    seen!
  - Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
  - Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his
    career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
- - How much money is involved?
  - A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
  - They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They
    don't waste time...
  - I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
  - No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
  - Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
  - Then get a large cash advance.
  - Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued
    over this.
  - Before they leave, get gold.
  - Right, right, what am I thinking of?
  - I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
  - I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for
    you -- anything!
- - So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight
    last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
  - You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
  - Was I?
- - Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and
    your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From
    there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful;
    an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial
    arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good
    to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
  - I want nothing to do with the arena.
  - Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
- - Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
  - Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway,
    I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
- - He's very realistic.
  - Isn't the helmet magnificent?
- - Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
  - Greeks?
  - Athenians...
- - What about their philosophy lessons?
  - They're studying with Cynics.
  - Of course...
- - You need to come home!
  - I can see that...
  - The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
  - If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides,
    I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
- - This is our oil from our estates?
  - I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised
    at how wonderful our oil has become.
- - Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
  - Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything
    we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
  - I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
  - We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
- - I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's
    just that Marcus trusts me.
  - Let him trust Quintus.
  - Quintus is overly idealistic.
  - I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
  - Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people
    outside the empire treat each other.
  - I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
  - What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
- - When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You
    should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
  - No!
- - You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
  - How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half
    a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
  - Narcissus!
  - Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he
    won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
  - I don't want you to die!
- - I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be
    there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
  - Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
  - They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps
    of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of
    the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the
    great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
  - You teach them!
  - That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
- - I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
  - Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
- - What the hell was all that about?
  - What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to
    the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
  - Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
  - Well, we can try...
- - Serious stuff...
  - Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last
    offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
- - Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
  - What deal?
  - Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
- - Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have
    you told your troops that?
  - My troops don't make policy.
  - Well, they die for it!
- - On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate
    may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and
    restocking that fort.
  - I can't let you do that.
- - You brought the army into Rome.
  - I was summoned.
  - It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
  - It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good
    ole Tribuus has been retired.
  - Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from
    Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
  - You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is
    dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty
    years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
  - Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become
    senators...
  - 'The ''people''?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government
    that gives them what they need and doesn''t bother them with messy thoughts of
    issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children,
    there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous
    gladiator!'
- - What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take
    the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
  - Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
- - I made the plume from a quail feather.
  - Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
- - Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon
    as I can.
  - Tomorrow?
  - As soon as I can.
  - On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
  - On my honor as your daddy...
- - Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
  - The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most
    vulnerable.
  - Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle
    for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience
    to wear the purple!
- - I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
  - I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
  - I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of
    our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
  - There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had
    Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
  - Servis made it through again?
  - He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
- - If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's
    my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now
    the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
  - Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
  - It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister
    is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the
    relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
  - So I understand.
  - Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance
    of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power
    -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared
    right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If
    the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take
    their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
  - You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
  - A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general
    is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about
    face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
  - Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
  - The Senators admire you.
  - They fear me.
  - They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship
    is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees
    the rebirth of the Republic.
  - I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that
    power.
- - No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
  - Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
- - 'You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?'
  - Only from a distance.
- - I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
  - Sneaking around with your brother?
  - Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as
    my adopted brother is very... exciting.
  - I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
  - Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
  - Why do you play at being drunk?
  - How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that
    right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time
    together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going
    to die, isn't he?
  - I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You
    know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
  - Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't
    you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism?
    Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left
    in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced,
    but... be careful.
- - It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
  - Yours will do!
- - I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative
    to Commodus, a hero.
  - You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
  - 'But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.'
- - Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was
    something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore
    -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives
    are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch
    line!
  - For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you
    are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
- - To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus,
    Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
  - Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The
    one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
- - '"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it
    is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire
    to be any better than the other threads. But..."'
  - '"But what if I wish to be purple?"'
- - You cannot die.
  - Would that Marcus had lived.
  - Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
  - He killed his father and then my family...
  - Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
- - Where are they?
  - Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts
    to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our
    misery, the sooner will they be safe.
- - You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our
    trial?
  - Why you?
  - My loyalties... were in doubt.
  - Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
  - That's what worries me...
- - Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
  - They can't... if this is Rome...
- - Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who
    I hear you are.
  - You're hearing about somebody else.
  - How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
  - When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
  - Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give
    me your word.
  - I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
  - You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
  - You don't know how wrong you are.
- - 'I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor''s health is the business of every
    soul in the empire.'
  - 'Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over --
    thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus''
    state?'
- - A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the
    core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
  - The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
  - We all know what right is, Senator.
- - The Senate too?
  - The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a
    friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know
    what you believed.
  - I hope you live to see what I believe...
- - The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the
    eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
  - God of passages and changes?
  - I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring
    Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
  - You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time
    of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
  - I've read of it.
  - But have never been?
  - My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over,
    time to close the door of war once and for all.
- - So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on
    the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
  - That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk
    and short on action.
  - I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
- - My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
  - The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
- - The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August
    thirty-first, you know.
  - That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can
    you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
  - Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will
    be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
- - It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated
    for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will
    you write it?
  - Yes, because I know they'll read it.
- - You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
  - This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've
    invited him to write a small piece about you...
  - I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know
    your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit
    about... well, who are you?
- - '"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules,
    has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The
    Emperor''s going to fight in the arena.  I''m supposed to write this for tomorrow''s
    edition.'
  - Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
- - Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
  - I don't know...
  - AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass
    craftsmen are working overtime.
  - I'll nose around...
  - You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus
    has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
- - Where is my father?
  - Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
- - Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
  - He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
- - Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
  - Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
- - Yes, Caesar?
  - Jerses -- tomorrow...
- - Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
  - Yes, Caesar.
  - We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens
    only, though...
- - Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at
    first light.
  - I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your
    presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
- - Marcus Aurelius has died.
  - He left us at dawn.
- - We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
  - I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
- - This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in
    power.
  - Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
- - It's because he comes off as the underdog.
  - Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor
    why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an
    accident.
  - You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed...
    and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take
    the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword.
    If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And
    you are a hero for awarding it.
- - Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
  - Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your
    victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel
    you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember
    your name.
- - The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid
    with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the
    first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
  - How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
- - Caesar, ignore them.
  - Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
  - At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
- - Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
  - Until your confirmation date.
- - And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it
    least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
  - At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my
    emperorship...
- - Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want
    then give him to them!
  - Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
  - Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
  - I'm serious.
  - So am I.
  - We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they
    really want?  Make them a gift of food.
  - Give away food?
  - Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can
    arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
  - Take grain away from the army?
  - Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
- - Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
  - I wouldn't know who to bet on.
- - Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart
    felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he
    needs rest. Likely just the weather.
  - Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
  - Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report
    to me.
- - Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
  - That's difficult to say, general.
  - Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
- - Then you'd be out of a job.
  - Gladly Caesar.
  - Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
- - I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not
    a politician...
  - Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a
    Republican by any chance?
- - I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
  - The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
- - But they're not destroyed, not yet.
  - Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I
    propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here
    there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
- - You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same
    for us.
  - You flatter me, Caesar.
  - Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
  - Caesar?
  - That this illness has clouded his mind.
- - I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the
    Danube.
  - We have to stop the Germans now!
- - Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate
    or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans
    they break!
  - They won't break this one.
  - Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
- - Where is my family?
  - Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
  - And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
- - 'The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory
    in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you''re just a hothead
    acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus
    have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing
    you, I''m sending you to Rome where you will be tried...'
  - On what charge?
- - Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return
    your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me
    and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
  - If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose
    you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you
    will never control human destinies again.
- - Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning
    into ice!
  - We're nearly there, Lucilla.
  - That's what you told me two days ago!
  - Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
  - I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
- - More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
  - I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
  - Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just
    remember, he is a married man.
- - Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
  - And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
- - Don't you think you should at least wave?
  - Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance
    aren't I?
- - They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
  - Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate
    a profound stability.
- - I should at least have you, don't you think?
  - If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up
    killing you for the throne.
- - Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
  - I'm sure, I don't know.
- - No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the
    Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin
    with.  Forget about him.
  - Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from
    me.
- - Those are priceless sculptures.
  - I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's
    worth something then sell it!
- - It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get
    this junk out of my sight.
  - Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that
    he can't heave out his ghost.
- - How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
  - If I may be so bold...
  - For the gods, spit it out!
  - Why not do it in the Colosseum?
- - Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
  - You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate
    you.
- - Tribuus... tomorrow.
  - You're coming back?
  - I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus,
    tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
- - Where have you been?
  - Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
  - You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
  - Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city
    is quiet.
  - What is that... wailing?
  - The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They
    believe he's dying.
- - Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back
    in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
  - What are you talking about?
  - Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
  - If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
  - But I get what I want, always, don't I?
- - '"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible
    climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."'
  - Yes?  Go on!
  - '"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates
    truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible
    there is more virtue within the arena than without?"'
- - Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
  - You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
  - I want that bastard dead!
  - You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
  - I am their hero!
  - Not yet, dear brother...
  - Send them out!
- - Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in
    the Daily Action...
  - Do you want posters, too?
- - Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
  - You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
  - What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this
    the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
- - Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ...
    Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have
    heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum
    energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
  - Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
- - Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
  - Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment
    building ... And they're most unusual.
  - Are you a Christian, Ray?
  - Mmmhmmm.
  - Me, too.
  - Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
  - Do you believe in God?
  - No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
  - Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
  - The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
  - Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise
    up from their graves?
  - And the seas would boil ...
  - Right.  And the sky would fall ...
  - Judgement Day ...
  - Yeah, Judgement Day.
  - Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
  - Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is
    because the dead have been rising from their graves?
- - You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
  - Right.  We'll believe anything.
- - Stantz?  You okay in there?
  - LATER, MAN!!
- - What's he talking about?  Choose what?
  - What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
- - Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can
    you come back in about an hour?
  - Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library
    on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It
    blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
  - Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check
    it out.  Let me know what happens.
  - No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings.
    Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I
    can feel it.
- - Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for
    the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something
    big.
  - Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend
    on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking
    out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And
    what have you seen?
  - What do you mean by "seen?"
  - Looked at with your eyes.
  - Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
  - Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too
    much time with Spengler.
- - What is it?
  - It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
- - I told you it's real.
  - What do we do now?
  - I don't know.  Talk to it.
  - What do I say?
  - Anything!  Just make contact.
  - Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of
    something else.
  - Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
- - '"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?'
  - I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this
    is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
  - Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out
    the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably
    the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
- - If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I
    think I could win the Nobel Prize.
  - If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research
    and designing the equipment.
  - Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's
    got to be worth something.
- - You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
  - Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did
    this to Galileo, too.
- - This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't
    touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
  - You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University.
    Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't
    stop progress.
  - Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us
    money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've
    worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You
    don't know what it's like out there.
  - Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate,
    call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of
    there.
  - For what purpose?
  - To go into business for ourselves.
- - You'll never regret this, Ray.
  - My parents left me that house, I was born there.
  - You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
  - But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
- - But most people are afraid to even report these things.
  - Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
- - Wow!  Does this pole still work?
  - This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper,
    don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when
    you're starting a new company.
- - Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
  - Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
  - Fourteen hundred.
- - Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
  - Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
- - How was your date?
  - It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
- - They will.
  - Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow
    problem.
- - So do I.
  - No sense worrying about it now.
  - Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No
    problem.
- - I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system
    to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
  - So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto
    Rican bellboy.
  - All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
- - Ray -- Something's here.
  - Where are you, Pete?
  - Third floor.  Get down here,
  - Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
  - Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
- - It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
  - Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
  - How do you know?
  - I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
- - Boy, that was a rough one.
  - I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
- - Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
  - It's not good, Pete.
- - I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
  - No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic
    whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling
    in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
  - Who was the architect?
  - He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
- - It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
  - I don't think it's Shandor.
- - As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of
    the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth
    and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural
    activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
  - Well, that ought to do it.
- - Agile bastard, isn't he?
  - Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
- - I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
  - What?  What popped in there?
  - Look!
- - AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
  - The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when
    I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
  - Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
- - You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
  - Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule
    out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
- - I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with
    any of the equipment.
  - I blame myself.
- - Sorry, Buddy!
  - We'd better adjust our streams.
- - Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
  - God, it's ugly!
- - It's working!
  - Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
- - Set entry grid.
  - Neutronize.  System shut.
- - I've got to sleep.
  - I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding
    up?
  - I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points
    to something big on the bottom.
- - What happened??!!!?
  - The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
- - Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry
    tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
  - And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
- - You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer
    will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
  - That appears to be the case.
- - Oh!  You're here.
  - What have you got, Egon?
  - Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
  - Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do
    you remember that?
- - Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
  - I'm always serious.
  - Wow!
- - Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five
    years come to over $75,000.
  - Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable
    defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and
    Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest
    dreams.
- - Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do
    you think, Egon?
  - She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
- - Did you see anything?
  - Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting
    to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things
    were going to start popping.
- - Something was definitely here.
  - Yeah, I can smell it.
- - Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
  - What?
  - Don't cross the beams.
  - Why not?
  - Trust me.  It will be bad.
  - What do you mean "bad?"
  - It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously
    and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
- - It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
  - What is it?
  - I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
  - Does she want to be?
  - I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does
    that make any sense to you?
  - Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
  - Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them
    to get together at this point.
  - I agree.
  - You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He
    could be very dangerous.
- - All right.  I'll try.
  - I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
  - All right, Peter.  Good night.
- - He wants to shut down the storage grid.
  - If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
- - Where's the Keymaster?
  - Oh, shit!
- - Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started
    a secret society in 1920.
  - Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
  - Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And
    he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted
    rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
  - She said he was "the Destructor."
  - Who?
  - Gozer.
  - You talked to Gozer?
  - Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer
    as the Destructor.
- - What now?
  - Full-stream with strogon pulse.
- - On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
  - No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
- - No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
  - Life is just a state of mind.
  - But it's my favorite state.
- - Yes?
  - Were you recently in the bathroom?
  - What on earth gave you that idea?
  - The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in
    your cheeks indicating ...
  - You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
  - When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually
    smelly?
- - Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
  - They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
  - Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
  - I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
- - Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those
    guns, would he feel it or what?
  - On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
  - Wow!
- - All right.  What is it?
  - A square?
  - Good guess -- but no.
- - Circle?
  - Close -- but definitely wrong.
- - Nervous?
  - Yes.  I don't like this.
  - Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
  - Two wavy lines?
  - Sorry.  This isn't your day.
- - Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
  - You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
  - Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you
    trying to prove?
  - I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
  - I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
  - Then my theory was correct.
- - Can I help you?
  - I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
  - Great!  How's it going?
  - Are you Peter Venkman?
  - Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
- - Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
  - I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
  - I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
  - You could say that.
  - And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
  - I'm not at liberty to say.
  - And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
  - In a storage facility.
  - And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
  - Yes, it would.
  - And may I see this storage facility?
  - No, you may not.
  - And why not, Mr. Venkman?
  - Because you didn't say the magic word.
  - And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
  - The magic word is "please."
- - May I please see the storage facility?
  - Why do you want to see it?
  - Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly,
    there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible
    environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious,
    possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's
    down there or I come back with a court order.
  - Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
  - Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
  - Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
- - At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding
    here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
  - Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more
    fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
- - You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find
    him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy
    zombie.
  - See!  They are using drugs.
- - The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
  - Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
- - Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
  - That's "Peck!"
  - '... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really
    Biblical proportions.'
- - Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and
    I'm running out of excuses.
  - Has this ever happened before?
  - Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances,
    I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was
    never ever this bad, though.
  - Did you ever report it to anyone?
  - Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could
    take care of this quietly tonight.
  - Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
- - Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls,
    Janine.
  - What calls?
- - Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
  - Here are tonight's calls.
- - And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
  - The EPA?  What's he want?
  - I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you
    promised you'd hire more help.
  - Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding
    a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
  - Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
- - You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
  - Print is dead.
  - That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too
    intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I
    also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
  - Is that a game?
  - It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem
    very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
  - I collect spores, molds and fungus.
  - Oh, that's very - unusual.
  - I think it's the food of the future.
  - Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
- - Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually
    and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen
    to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
  - Die in what sense?
  - In the physical sense.
  - I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living
    on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
  - That's so romantic.
- - I want you to have this.
  - What is it?
  - It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky
    coin.
  - I don't believe in luck.
  - Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
  - Thank you.
- - Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
  - Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
  - Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly
    and quietly.
  - One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
- - What's that got to do with it?
  - Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
- - Did you see it?  What was it?
  - We'll get back to you.
- - That is one speedy mutt.
  - He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
  - Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
- - Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
  - Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
  - You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the
    middle of the street.
  - I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in
    the area.
  - That would definitely explain it.
- - I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
  - No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate
    your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
  - This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
  - Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your
    group's activities.
  - But why?  The students love us!
  - Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You,
    however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories
    are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions
    are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no
    place in this department or in this University.
  - I see.
- - Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
  - Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
  - We're all professionals here, Miss ...
  - Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
- - '... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.'
  - So what do you think it was?
- - Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
  - Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
- - Is that your professional opinion?
  - It's in the stars.
- - No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
  - Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll
    take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
- - Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
  - No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm
    not ready to do that.
- - You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
  - Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
  - I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
  - That's a violin concerto.
  - Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
- - You really don't act like a scientist.
  - No?  What do I act like?
  - Like a used car salesman.
  - Thanks.  What's in there?
- - That's too bad.
  - What?
  - Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
- - Uh-huh.
  - Well, let's check it out.
  - I'll wait here if you don't mind.
- - You're quite a housekeeper.
  - I told you, I ...
  - I know.  It happened by itself.
- - Damn!
  - Are you all right?
  - Yeah, yeah.
- - There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
  - This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
  - If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
  - Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
  - I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that
    something happened here and I want to do something about it.
  - All right.  What do you want to do?
  - I think I should spend the night here.
  - That's it.  Get out.
  - On a purely scientific basis.
  - Out!
  - I want to help you.
  - I'll scream.
  - Don't scream.
  - Then leave.
  - Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
  - All right.
  - Okay.  Then I'll go.
  - Goodbye.
  - No kiss?
- - Great rehearsal.
  - You heard it?
  - You're the best one in your row.
  - Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
  - I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to
    me.
  - I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info
    ... about my case?
  - Who's the stiff?
  - The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a
    wonderful man.
  - Is he dying or something?
- - He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my
    apartment?
  - Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
  - Can't you tell me now?
  - I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide
    to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
  - You must have gotten the last copy.
  - Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ...
    What's that say?
  - Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
  - '"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.'
  - What's he doing in my refrigerator.
  - I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about
    it.
  - I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
  - You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making
    an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
  - All right.  Since you put it that way.
  - I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can
    read after we eat.
  - I've got to go now.
- - Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
  - I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
- - We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
  - Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
  - He is the Destructor.
  - Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really
    like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
- - Do you want this body?
  - Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
  - Take me now.
- - Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
  - I want you inside me.
  - I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little
    crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to
    Dana and I want Dana to answer.
  - I am Zuul.  I am ...
  - Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
  - There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
  - Whoa!! Nice voice.
- - Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
  - Really!  Is it gone?
  - Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This
    one took some work.
  - Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
- - This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
  - Talk to my accountant.
- - Oh, Dana, it's you ...
  - Hi, Louis.
  - '... I thought it was the drug store.'
  - Are you sick, Louis?
- - Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising.
    So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it
    only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral
    water with me?
  - No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
  - Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other
    nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having
    a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I
    know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're
    my next door neighbor and all ...
  - Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
  - You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down
    the hall phoned the manager.
  - I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
- - Oh, Dana, it's you.
  - Hi, Louis.
  - Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
  - Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
  - Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese
    and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
  - Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
  - I got the Twister game for later ...
- - Are you the Gatekeeper?
  - I am Zuul.
- - Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
  - I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
  - All right, what happened to me?
- - Is it a star?
  - It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
- - Ready?  What is it?
  - Ummm -- figure eight?
  - Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
  - No.  They're just coming to me.
  - Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
- - Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
  - Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
  - Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
- - Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some
    time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
  - Eight o'clock?
  - I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
- - Aren't you glad we waited?
  - I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
  - Well, thanks a lot.
- - Roy?  Your clock broke.
  - Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
  - I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
- - Now where are you going?
  - To the bathroom, where do you think?
  - Have I done the right thing?
- - Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
  - Uuuuuuugh!!
  - What's the matter, dear?
- - I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
  - Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
  - So we'll put a warning on the label.
- - Tell him about the toaster.
  - I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
- - It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
  - You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s
    are true?
- - And pure --
  - And decent.
- - Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
  - Wonder what?
  - If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
- - How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
  - It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
- - My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there
    wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you,
    Dana?
  - Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
- - Ready?
  - I'm ready.
  - Then let's do it.
- - That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from
    over-privileged nine-year-olds.
  - Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best
    season.
- - Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In
    a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
  - Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
  - Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot
    marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
  - Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
- - Does it have any favorites?
  - 'It likes all the sappy stuff: ''Cumbaya,'' ''Everything is Beautiful,'' ''It''s
    a Small World'' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.'
- - And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
    disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
  - I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
- - You got a flux and a half.
  - Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
    from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until
    we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
- - Now that's one ugly dude.
  - Huh?  What?
  - You finished here?
  - What?  Yeah.
  - Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
  - No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
- - Are you telling me how to drive?
  - No, I just thought --
  - Well don't think!
- - Are you all right?
  - Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I
    couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know
    -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
- - Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
  - Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
  - You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
  - Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
- - What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
  - Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
- - She's moving!
  - I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now
    I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
- - Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
  - Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
- - Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion
    I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit
    to an unusual personal request.
  - Oh, hiya, Pete.
  - So, no goat hooves, huh?
  - I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
  - Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
  - Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
- - Great.  So what are you guys working on?
  - Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
  - Who?
  - Who?  Just -- someone we know.
  - Oh, Ray --
- - Who?  Who?  Who?
  - Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
  - Who, Ray?
  - Dana!  Dana Barrett!
- - Well, Holmes, what do you think?
  - It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued
    now.
- - What's that?
  - Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in
    GEVs - giga electron volts.
- - I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going
    to make some headlines with this one.
  - Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd
    be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
  - Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
- - Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
  - Okay, let's heat 'em up!
- - I'm Ray --
  - I'm Peter --
- - Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
    giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service
    plan.
  - Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
  - I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
- - You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
  - If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
- - Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
  - It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
- - And now you're going to eat it?
  - No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
- - This is what you do with your spare time?
  - This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever
    this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
  - '''Mood slime.''  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.'
- - Like a goat on garbage.
  - We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
  - What kind of tests?
  - Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
  - You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
- - Did you find anything at Dana's?
  - 'Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did
    turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found
    the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger''s Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen
    to this:'
- - Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's
    playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
  - I'll get one more reading.
- - What happened?
  - You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
- - Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
  - We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the
    psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
  - Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
- - I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what
    you find out.
  - Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
- - You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
  - Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's
    really kind of a coat and tie place.
  - It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
- - It looks like a giant Jello mold.
  - I hate Jello.
- - Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
  - Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
- - I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
  - Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
- - I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll
    go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
  - Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take
    72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
- - I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
  - We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
- - My Fault!
  - She's new in town.
- - Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
  - The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you,
    you know.
- - I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
  - Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
- - My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the
    statue from the boat when they arrived.
  - Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese,
    as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
- - What's your story, Pete?
  - Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch
    -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
- - We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
  - You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
- - There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus
    and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
  - I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
- - Is the line sinking?
  - No, the slime is rising.
- - Rivers of the stuff!
  - And it's all flowing toward the museum.
- - Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
  - There's something very familiar about this painting.
- - Who was that?
  - Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
  - This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled
    approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
  - You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled
    psychokinesis.
  - Good idea.
- - Nothing.  Not a trace.
  - Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
- - The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced
    air-trains, built around 1870.
  - This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
  - What's the reading?
- - Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
  - His nickname is "The Hammer."
- - Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down
    there.
  - It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
- - I'm Egon --
  - And we're the ...
- - No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
    Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
  - This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this
    prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door,
    time is but a window.  I'll be back."
- - Six feet -- seven -- eight --
  - That's it.  It's on the bottom.
  - Nine feet -- ten --
- - If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on,
    Ray.  Try me, sucker.
  - Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
- - It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack
    that shell.
  - I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back.
    Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd
    just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks
    of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
  - We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
- - Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
  - Something good --
- - Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
  - Do it!  Just do it!
- - Egon!
  - Hello, Venkman.
  - How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that
    big cranium of yours, huh?
  - I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
  - I don't even want to know where that is.
- - I'd like to have a stool specimen
  - Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
- - What now, Brainiac?
  - I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
  - Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
- - That's a thousand million electron volts.
  - I knew that.
- - You were supposed to help me with this.
  - You need the exercise.
- - '"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"'
  - A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
- - That's it?  "I'll be back?"
  - It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
- - You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given
    the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach
    population.
  - Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under
    the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind
    of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
- - Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
  - This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
- - It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
  - They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
- - So far so good.
  - I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded
    her feet.
- - Pretty impressive, huh?
  - It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
  - From where -- Neptune?
  - They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
  - Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
- - Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
  - Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
- - So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants
    took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
  - Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone
    would notice.
- - I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember
    that you're under oath.
  - I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the
    truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding,
    things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's
    where we come in.
  - So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
  - No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
- - Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting
    with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt,
    your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing
    about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read
    a book about it?
  - Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
  - Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
  - I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
  - This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales
    point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the
    paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year
    after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would
    have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
  - This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I
    have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
  - Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree
    with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
- - Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
  - I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
  - Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
  - I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
  - Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
  - Like what?
  - I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
  - You were the one who got me in.
  - I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
  - Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could
    get in a lot of trouble.
  - I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something
    fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's
    just a scared little baby, Sherm.
  - Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
- - This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised
    him a ride in the car if he got you out.
  - Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had
    a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it
    was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
- - Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
  - I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
  - I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
- - The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
  - Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team
    for underprivileged children?
- - Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have
    some bearing on this case?
  - Do I?
- - Your honor, may I approach the bench?
  - Yes.
- - Can I have some of your water?
  - Get on with it, counselor!
  - Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair
    to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I
    was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom
    the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they
    helped me.  Thank you.
- - That's it?  That's all you have to say?
  - Did I forget something?
- - Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
  - Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
- - You've got to do something!
  - Who are they?
  - They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted
    up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
  - Maybe they just want to appeal.
- - These boys aren't playing around.
  - You've got to stop them.  Please!
- - I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
  - Command me, lord.
  - On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What
    was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child
    that I might live again.
- - I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
  - Yes, the scourge --
  - -- the sorrow of Moldavia --
  - -- the sorrow --
  - I command you.
  - I await the word of Vigo.
  - The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child
    that I might live again.
  - Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would
    it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
  - So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother
    to me.
- - Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
  - How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
- - It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait
    of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the
    17th Century.
  - Too bad for the Moldavians.
  - ''
- - We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
  - Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
- - I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
  - My pleasure.
- - Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
  - I know.
  - Then why have you come?
  - We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was
    first.
- - You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
  - The Upper West Side.
- - This is the one that looked at Dana.
  - It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
  - I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her,
    it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look
    at me when I'm talking to you.
- - So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
  - Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities.
    We'll be back.
- - You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't
    you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of
    flies to him.
  - Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
- - What is it, honey?
  - It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave
    us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
  - Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
- - Who are you going to call?
  - Ghostbusters.
- - Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
  - What are you doing up here?
  - I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm
    like the fifth Ghostbuster.
  - Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
  - Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
- - Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
  - No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first.
    That way I beat the crowds.
  - That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
- - Well, good night, Louis.
  - Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
  - I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with
    me?
  - Oh, sure, that sounds great.
- - I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
  - So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then
    one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
  - It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
  - So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was
    a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and
    social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess
    it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
- - You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here
    and sit with me?
  - Okay.
- - Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself.
    Wouldn't you?
  - Tonight?
- - Should we go?
  - I don't think we should leave her alone.
  - You're right.  We should stay.
- - I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
  - Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need
    some back-up at the museum.
  - You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
- - Can I help you?
  - Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
- - I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
  - I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
  - I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
  - No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the
    city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms
    like you.
  - Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going
    to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to
    be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You
    read me?
- - That's quite a story.
  - Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a
    lot of fun with it, too.
- - Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling
    this slime thing to some people downtown?
  - Now you're talking.
- - Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car
    and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
  - Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
    in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight,
    when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing
    amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
- - According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
  - Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
  - I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn,
    I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then
    he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me
    follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
  - Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
  - It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday
    Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
  - No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't
    trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but
    most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out
    of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this
    is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
- - Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
  - No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
  - Hi, Egon.
- - Is this the spot?
  - A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
- - I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
  - Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes
    me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
- - Sorry!
  - Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
- - Hello, Peter.
  - You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into
    all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
  - I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
  - I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science,
    I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
- - So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to
    Europe.
  - He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra
    in England and he took it.
  - He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
  - You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
  - Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
  - Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when
    I left.
  - I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
- - What do you think?
  - There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely
    ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby
    I ever smelled.  What's his name?
  - His name is Oscar.
  - Oscar!  You poor kid!
  - Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual
    about him.
  - Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
- - I'll do it.
  - I'll supervise.
- - Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And
    the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some
    good times, didn't we?
  - We definitely had a moment or two.
- - That's where the buggy stopped.
  - Okay, let's take a look.
- - I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
  - You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit
    me at Sing Sing?
  - Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
  - Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
  - You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
  - I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
  - Good luck.
  - Thanks.
- - So this is what you do, huh?
  - Oh, hello, Peter.
  - You're really good, you know.
  - I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth
    about ten million dollars.
- - I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
  - As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem
    and that we're still on the case.
- - He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt
    very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
  - Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know
    what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
- - I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
  - Good-bye, Peter.
  - I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call
    you.  Later, Johnny!
- - I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
  - No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
  - Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
- - You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from
    you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
  - I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible
    painting of Vigo looked right at me.
  - Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
  - I don't know what to do anymore.
  - I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
- - This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with
    this. Just don't pee in it.
  - Peter, what about the bathtub?
  - We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ...
    Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
  - It was full of this awful pink ooze.
  - Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ...
    Right ... Let me know.
- - Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
  - Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
- - Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed
    the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely
    plan on spending the night here.
  - Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
  - For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your
    arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in
    my face all night.
  - How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
  - Or we could do that.
  - Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
  - I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks
    out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
- - Are you all squeaky clean now?
  - Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
- - They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So,
    what do I do now?
  - Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust
    me, you need it.
  - I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't
    know.
  - It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
  - Does she know anything about babies?
  - Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear
    something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
  - Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
- - Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
  - I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
  - I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of
    laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
- - So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
  - I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
  - Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few
    days maybe?
  - For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely
    real?
  - All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
  - Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't
    very good for me, you know.
  - I'm not even good for me.
  - Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
  - Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely
    shape up by the turn of the century.
  - So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
  - Let me jingle you right now.
- - Maybe I should call Janine.
  - Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
- - I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
  - Finally came to your senses, huh?
- - That's not true.  It was 1620.
  - Same difference.
- - That's a terrible thing to say.
  - So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
- - Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
  - I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
  - You're also a human being, Frank.
  - Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes
    the grocery bags from her.
  - Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
- - Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
  - That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
  - Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I
    asked you last week.
  - Didn't I do it?
- - No, you didn't, Frank.
  - Okay, that's no problem.
  - That's exactly what you said last week.
- - Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
  - I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
- - What are you working on, Egon?
  - I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect
    on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on
    when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
- - We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
    it's all right with you.
  - Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
  - Oh no.
  - Do you ever see him?
  - Occasionally
  - How is he these days?
  - Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
  - Does he ever mention me?
  - No.  Not that I can recall.
- - This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
  - Certainly.
  - Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
  - I won't.
  - Thank you.
- - Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
  - You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready
    to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
  - Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older,
    I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
- - We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
  - Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better
    go.
- - Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have
    bad breath or something?
  - I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
  - Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
- - Janosz?
  - Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
    see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything?
    Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
- - Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
  - No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
  - Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs
    bite you.
  - Good night, Janosz.
- - Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
  - Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
- - What do you want with my baby?
  - No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will
    be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother
    of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
  - If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
  - I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
  - Everybody has a choice.
  - Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up
    there. He's Vigo!
  - I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
- - Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine
    -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to
    make the best of our relationship.
  - We don't have a relationship.
  - I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are
    many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will
    supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
  - I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I
    could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
  - Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe
    we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
  - I'd rather not.
- - Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
  - I don't believe you had a mother.
- - How many cattle?
  - Four should do it.
  - They will want a lot of money.
- - Why so many?
  - Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other
    the men.
- - Did you ever see a lion that size?
  - Not even close.  What happened?
- - Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave,
    close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any
    questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay
    there.
  - And where will you sleep beautifully?
  - Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness
    still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood
    will be irresistible.
- - Where do you go next?
  - Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
  - Help finish the railroad.
- - My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed
    because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something
    grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
  - Some mysteries should not have solutions.
  - Hold your son high.
- - Why do the workers look unhappy?
  - Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come,
    John- to the bridge.
- - It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
  - 'Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.'
  - The workers don't get on?
  - Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the
    Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat
    them.
- - Did it look like this in your mind?
  - This is more difficult-
- - I am also liaison between these two.
  - Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
- - What are they looking at?
  - You- they cannot believe you're still here.
  - Nonsense.
  - You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
- - We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
  - Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half
    your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier.
    But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build
    the bridge.
- - Oh yes, I think so.
  - Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
- - For you.
  - Thank you, Samuel.
  - Good news?
  - I expect so- it's from my wife.
  - Do you love her?
  - I do, actually; very much.
  - You give me hope, John.
- - Soon.
  - I have to ask- why do you need me?
- - You like him, don't you?
  - Oh yes. But it takes time.
  - You've known him long?
  - Since his beard was red.
- - Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
  - He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am
    afraid of lions...
- - Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good
    idea once.
  - I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't
    need it.
- - He has children?
  - Once...
- - Where is it?
  - Underneath.  Somewhere.
- - Afraid of lions.
  - It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
- - I didn't have a chance to thank you.
  - What did I do?
  - Got me out of trouble.
  - Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
  - We need to talk.
  - Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm
    here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be
    in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will
    help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what
    I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
  - Actually, no.
  - All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
  - Somehow I guessed.
- - I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three
    days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge.
    And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
  - That's very considerate.
  - I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
- - Have you got it?
  - No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp
    before dawn.
- - The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot
    while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you
    ever led trackers?
  - I can try.
  - Samuel says you killed a lion.
  - It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
  - You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by
    luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there
    and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you.
- - '...misfire... it jammed...'
  - Has it ever done that before?
  - '...don''t know...'
- - Think about something else.
  - Have you ever failed?
  - Only in life...
- - Goddammit!
  - It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
- - Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used
    the same device myself once.
  - But of course yours worked.
  - In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
- - "It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied\
    \ with other business, I\tsuppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that\
    \ kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's\
    \ graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and..."
  - You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and
    I'm going after them crack of dawn...
- - In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But
    he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother
    was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem
    came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone
    they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
  - What happened to them?
  - I got big.
- - Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
  - Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're
    doing it for pleasure.
- - Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions,
    yes?
  - Don't they have to be?...
- - They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
  - Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others
    to the water tower for the night.
  - I'll be bait alone?
  - Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can
    you control your fear?
  - I'll have to.
  - I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
  - Was that supposed to make me feel better?
- - It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
  - You think they'll come then?  Why?
  - Good luck.
  - Why?
  - Because I think they're after you.
- - How many do you think they've killed?
  - The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
- - I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
  - Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
  - Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever
    reason, I'm glad you came.
- - Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at
    Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
  - He just gave me his "monster" speech.
  - That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well,
    he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your
    first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.
- - Don't much like them.
  - The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't
    survive because the males eat the young.
- - Anything special about them?
  - Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
  - I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you
    been here?
  - Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life.
- - Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring
    Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
  - Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
  - We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept
    salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products
    of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
  - Have you got that in writing?
- - Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
  - Does he speak English?
- - Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
  - I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
- - Finish your tour?
  - And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
  - Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts,
    He will vanquish all pain.
- - I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal
    thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast
    this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
  - Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible
    for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if
    a man-eater's on the prowl.
- - You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
  - We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've
    attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so
    they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their
    pride because they can't keep up.
- - I don't suppose I could watch.
  - Might be exciting for you.
  - I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
  - I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
  - Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed!
- - I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually
    quite unbearable now.
  - Shhh.
  - I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
  - -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
  - That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
- - John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
  - What?
  - Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you
    hunt lions?
  - Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen
    one.
- - '...one shot...'
  - So that's what a lion looks like.
- - With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
  - -true enough- but without the comedy relief.
- - How lucky we are.
  - Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
  - Possibly.
- - All right- thee second embankment will go there.
  - You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
  - In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and
    you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be
    finished in eight thrilling weeks.
  - John, it will not be easy.
  - Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
- - I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry
    off a man Singh's size.
  - But you said they were always old.
  - That's what the books say...
- - Second death? Where?-
  - -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body
    now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
  - But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
- - What a good week.
  - You mean nobody died?
  - We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My
    mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out
    to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I
    like the blood, is that strange?
- - Very good indeed.
  - We have hunted since childhood.
  - All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition.
    You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
  - That is correct.  Nothing.
- - Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
  - -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept
    moving-
  - -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet
    away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
  - I assure you we came close many times-
- - I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
  - We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
  - Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he
    is to have you?
  - It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
- - Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
  - -well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
  - -oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me.
    You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
  - What if there are complications?-
  - -not "what if"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our "son"
    and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.
- - Go, now.  Such a gentleman.
  - I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
- - That's a terrible idea-
  - -is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
  - Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
  - I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting,
    what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible
    that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already
    contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you
    question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing,
    that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a
    fool, please say so now.
  - I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day
    he arrived.
  - Then we agree.
- - I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get
    sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost
    the knack.
  - You never had it.
  - Nigel and I don't like each other much.
- - A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
  - Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion
    sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
- - -then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
  - -please- you needn't be so graphic-
  - You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
- - This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory
    trade, make men richer.
  - Then why do you stay?
  - Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought
    you a little welcoming gift.
- - I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but
    what are you going to do about it?
  - Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With
    any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
- - You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.
  - You don't enjoy killing, do you?
  - Then why do it?
- - John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells
    me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started,
    many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning
    personality, heaps of charm?
  - My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
  - 'Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting
    people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this:
    I''ll make you hate me.'
- - -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can
    you do that?
  - I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a
    bridge.
  - You've never built in Africa.
  - But I have in India- every country presents problems.
  - You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
  - 'I''ve got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in
    five months and I promised I''d be with her when the baby comes.'
  - Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give
    a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't
    make me break you.
  - You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train
    to catch.
- - Pleasant journey?
  - How could it be? I hate Africa.
- - Lovely sound- they seem happy.
  - Don't they, though?
  - So work must be going well?
- - Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely
    told me, I'd never built in Africa.
  - But overall, you're pleased?
- - I do need to see Starling.
  - Starling?
  - Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
  - Yes he is.
  - Well, I need to speak to him.
- - It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
  - -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
  - It hasn't been that simple so far.
  - What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed?
- - This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
  - I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence,
    to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
- - In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door
    will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
  - Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping
    him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
- - Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as
    this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
  - I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble
    with a tiger.
  - And it worked?
  - In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
- - What?
  - I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
  - You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except
    there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so
    important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified
    and bring him here?
- - Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months
    behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about
    you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if
    this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional
    hunters may be the answer.
  - All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they
    come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
  - I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
  - Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him,
    the lions will be dead.
  - Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished.
    And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told
    you you'd hate me.
- - Understand, I had help-
  - -not a time for modesty, Bob-
- - No hints, Samuel.
  - You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
  - You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
- - I am a man of peace.
  - Am I to take it you want to live?
  - Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
  - Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and
    enjoy the splendid morning.
  - I think it's been a pleasure.
- - Starting now, we attack them.
  - How; we don't know where they are?
  - 'We''ll have to make them come to us, won''t we? And since there are two of them,
    we''re going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital
    by tomorrow night.'
- - You were contracted to work-
  - -malaria epidemic; very sudden.
  - Let me see the sick.
  - Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
  - There is no reason for fear.
  - On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights.
- - -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so
    stop telling me there is-
  - -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself
    fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided
    to stay-
  - You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
- - He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
  - He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
  - You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run
    home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the
    railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who
    worked here, they were the only ones to flee-
- - Morning, friend, glorious day.
  - As are they all.
- - The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
  - -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
  - -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
- - I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in
    Tsavo-
  - -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
  - -careful, Abdullah-
- - I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned
    to shit.
  - So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
  - Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes
    for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
  - Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn
    out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
  - It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few
    months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection
    out of storage...
  - Why don't we start with that next week?
- - Thank you, doctor.
  - Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
- - Seymour?
  - Yes?
  - Do you have a check for me?
- - Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
  - She's not at home?
  - No... they said she was here...
  - What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
  - Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
  - Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
  - Why would she be hiding from me?
  - I don't know... where is she, then?
  - Maybe she's with Josh?
  - Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
  - I don't know.
  - Why? What did she tell you?
  - She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought
    maybe she was...
  - What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
  - I have no idea - I just want to...
  - Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself...
    you're crazy.
  - Really, I don't know enough about it to...
  - That slut!
  - Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about
    me?
  - Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
  - Did she say that?
  - Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
  - What do you mean?
  - On that pathetic fake blind date.
  - What are you talking about?
  - Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
  - What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
- - I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different
    ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are
    amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious
    in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political;
    of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type
    of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
  - I am.
  - Talk to us about it...
  - It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I
    feel super-strongly about.
  - Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category
    of art I was speaking of earlier.
- - What do we have here, Margaret?
  - It's a tampon in a teacup...
- - I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of
    sculpture is this?
  - It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places
    it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
  - Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
  - I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in
    the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with
    this... like...
  - This shocking image of repressed femininity!
  - Right, exactly!
  - I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
- - Please Josh?
  - Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
- - So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
  - He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to
    somebody!
- - I agree.
  - I wish I could see him.
- - Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
  - Yeah.
  - Call me sometime.
- - Well, here's where the fun never stops!
  - Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
  - Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
- - Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She
    could at least have the decency to call me back.
  - Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could
    be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female
    brain, that's for sure.
- - Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
  - Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
  - No problem.
- - So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
  - They're Seymour's.
  - Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
  - Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
  - Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run
    without swinging the bat!
  - Right.
- - Do you have any old Indian records?
  - Indian records?
  - You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
  - I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties
    in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
- - Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
  - Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
- - There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
  - Sure, I guess.
  - Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues
    stuff.
- - Is this one any good?
  - Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
- - This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original
    78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer
    and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use
    on this reissue.
  - Wow!
- - How much is it?
  - A dollar seventy-five.
  - Okay.
- - Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that
    song it was like --
  - So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked
    that Memphis Minnie, huh?
  - Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil
    Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have
    any other records like that?
  - The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records
    like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of
    maybe five known copies.
  - Wow!
  - Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
  - Yeah, sure, I guess...
  - Watch my stuff.
- - Oops! I dropped it!
  - NO!!!
  - Hey, I was only kidding!
- - What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
  - I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean
    if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a
    real party or anything.
  - You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
  - Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
  - Really? Can I see it?
  - Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these
    guys in there at once... you know...
- - Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
  - I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection
    to the essential...
  - God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy
    in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
  - Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
  - Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
  - You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other
    people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these
    pathetic collector losers.
- - No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
  - Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I
    can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
  - I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you
    in a minute!
  - Oh, right...
  - No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
  - Good luck...
  - I'm totally serious!
  - Yeah, well...
  - I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating
    service!
  - I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
  - Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
  - Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
- - What about her? Would you go out with her?
  - I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because
    a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
  - But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
  - I really didn't get a good look at her.
- - Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
  - Jesus!
  - C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you
    your perfect dream girl?
  - I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
  - Every guy has a type!
  - I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
- - We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet
    women who share your interests.
  - Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests!
    Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
  - Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
  - Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime
    music at the top of the list, then probably...
  - Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go
    in here for a second...
- - So is that your boyfriend?
  - Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
  - Well are --
  - Oh my god! We have to go in here!
- - Yeah, sure... very funny....
  - Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get
    any boys to take us...  Please?
  - I - I'd really rather not...
  - We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
  - I don't think so...
  - PLEASE? We have to!
  - I really don't think it's a good idea.
  - Fine, I'll go by myself then...
- - Wow! Look at all these creeps!
  - Shh!
  - OH MY GOD!
- - Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
  - These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
- - Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
  - C'mon, Seymour, please?
- - Relax, Seymour, relax...
  - That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing
    me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
- - So, why did you bring this along?
  - I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one
    of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not
    the headliner. What an insult!
  - This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
  - I'm not holding my breath in that department.
- - What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids,
    why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
  - Jesus, Seymour.
- - Yes, that would certainly do...
  - Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
  - Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about.
    No! No...
  - Just wait here.
- - What did you tell that girl?
  - I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that
    band to your label.
  - Jesus...
  - Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same
    universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
  - We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total
    idiot, that's all.
  - Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
  - It's not hopeless...
  - Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes
    and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
  - Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally
    hopeless...
  - But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy
    to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything
    I do so you don't end up like me...
  - I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're
    an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
  - Hooray for me.
- - I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
  - It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince
    you not to give up yet.
  - '"Yet."'
- - Wow, this is so cool...
  - If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
  - I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't
    get a date...
- - What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
  - What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess
    it's mine now.
  - What, are you a klansman or something?
  - Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken
    franchise?
  - '"Four-piece Cook''s special deep fried with side n'' slaw it''s OUT RAY-GEOUS"!'
  - Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in
    1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their
    first logo.
- - Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was
    about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
  - You work at Cook's Chicken?
  - For nineteen years...
  - What are you, a fry cook or something?
  - Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate
    headquarters.
  - Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
  - Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
  - Yeah, but still...
  - I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
- - So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even
    though there was stuff like this?
  - No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody
    still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
  - Hey, can I borrow this?
  - What? Why?
  - I promise I'll take good care of it.
  - I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would
    be better if you --
  - Don't you trust me, Seymour?
- - You can open your eyes now.
  - Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
  - No, Doofus... blow it out!
- - Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
  - Are you okay?
  - It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
- - What is that?
  - Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
  - What, like a girdle?
  - Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
  - Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems...
    It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
  - That's the spirit!
  - I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend
    for more than like two weeks!
  - Really?
  - Never...
  - I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change
    anything.
  - I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
  - Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure
    you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
  - Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really
    fucked-up situation...
  - Oh yeah?
  - Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed
    with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
  - Why?
  - Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when
    you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
  - I won't even dignify that with a response.
- - I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact
    that nobody else likes them?
  - Who knows?
- - Aren't you going to get that?
  - Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling
    me...
- - Wow!  What was that all about?
  - It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
  - That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
  - Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying
    to humiliate me.
  - Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
  - How can you be so sure?
  - Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
- - Uh... hello?
  - Hi, it's me...
  - Oh, hi...
  - So, what happened?
  - Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think
    everything's going pretty well...
  - What? You're kidding me...
  - Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
  - What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
  - Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
- - Boo!
  - YAAA!
- - Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering
    the streets day and night trying to find you...
  - Really?
  - No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
  - I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
  - Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
  - Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
  - So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
  - Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually,
    we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
  - Sounds good...
- - We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this
    week --
  - What, are you trying to get rid of me?
  - No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
  - Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
  - I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
  - I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
  - '...so... is he your boyfriend now?'
  - Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at
    the present time...
- - I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something
    I have to show you...
  - I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
  - Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
  - '...I better not...'
  - Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
  - I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that
    I --
  - Well when can we do something?
  - It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship
    and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
- - Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
  - And you like them?
  - Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable
    guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
  - So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
  - No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
  - What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
  - No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody
    like you...
  - What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
  - Just someone so young...
  - You must have done something to make her think you like me.
  - I... I don't think so.
  - Does that mean you don't like me?
  - No, of course not.
  - So, do you like me, Seymour?
  - In what way do you mean?
  - In whatever way you think I mean.
  - I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want
    to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back
    to being friends...
  - I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
  - '...What do you mean?'
  - Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
- - What are you doing here?
  - I had to see you.
  - What's up?
  - Can you at least let me in?
  - Uh... sure... come in.
  - Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave
    you alone.
  - What's the matter?
  - Do you have anything to drink?
- - Uh... I think there's some root beer...
  - What about this?
- - That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You
    better not --
  - FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
- - You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
  - I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
- - Where did you get this?
  - Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff,
    so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
  - Jesus, how can you stand her?
- - God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
  - That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural
    pessimist!
  - If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
  - What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
  - I'm just being realistic.
  - At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about
    are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
  - I hate sports.
  - How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
  - You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest
    in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
  - Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
  - I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
  - I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I
    guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
  - Yeah, sure. Of course.
  - '...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and
    dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.'
  - What about Joe?
  - Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been
    acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour,
    that's why I like you.
  - Yeah, well I like you too...
- - You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
  - What?
  - I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going
    to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
  - I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
  - It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and
    I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
  - Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
  - You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off!
    We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life...
    fuck everybody!
  - I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
  - I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
  - So where would we go?
  - Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
  - I dunno, I...
  - I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
  - What do you want?
  - What do you want?
  - I-I-I...
  - What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your
    life!
- - God, Dana's going to kill you!
  - '...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?'
  - What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
  - I will if you want to.
  - No... forget it...
  - I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
  - Yeah, well... me neither...
  - You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
  - I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana
    -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
  - But, I...
  - Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
- - I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving
    in here...
  - I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
- - That's five hundred dollars.
  - What?
  - Five hundred.
  - You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
  - I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
  - Well why do I care about that?
  - Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
  - God, fuck you!
- - Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
  - You're late, asshole.
  - Fine, and how are you?
  - Did you bring that tape?
- - You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
  - I did too!
  - Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
  - Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
- - Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
  - Hey, where are you going?
  - Later, "Dude".
- - Hi... what's your name?
  - Norman.
  - '...are you waiting for a bus?'
  - Yes.
  - I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There
    are no buses on this street.
  - You don't know what you're talking about.
- - Didn't they tell you?
  - Tell me what?
  - Punk rock is over!
  - I know it's over, asshole, I --
  - 'If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school
    -- that''s what I''m gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things
    up from the inside!'
  - That's not even --
  - Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
- - Oh, how "punk."
  - That tape sucked, by the way!
  - I'm so sorry if you were offended!
- - Go die, asshole!
  - Get a job!
- - A what?
  - A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic
    piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
  - How much is this?
  - Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the
    time being.
- - Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You
    shread like a giant. Just press a button.
  - That's okay...
- - Do you have any other old records besides these?
  - Seymour does.
  - Who does?
  - Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
- - You still interested in that?
  - I thought it wasn't for sale.
  - I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
  - It's kind of falling apart.
- - Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
  - Where did you get those pants?
- - It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love
    to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part
    in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart
    little girl.
  - I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
- - May I ask what you're doing?
  - Shhh!
  - I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying
    your father to death!
  - Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
  - Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether
    you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
- - Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
  - Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
  - So what are you guys doing this Summer?
  - Nothing.
  - I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions
    soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this
    summer!
  - Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
  - Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
- - Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
  - What are you doing here, Melorra?
  - My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
  - Well, we won't keep you.
  - I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
- - What about me? Am I not even here?
  - Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
- - We're not.
  - Really? Both of you?... Why not?
  - Just because.
- - What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
  - Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
  - See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.
- - God, what a bunch of retards...
  - I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
  - I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in
    one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves
    her.
  - It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
- - What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
  - What?
  - These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid
    art class!
  - Why?
  - Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't
    think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over
    again.
  - You loser.
- - This is so bad, it's almost good.
  - This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
- - Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
  - Unless they're in your Summer school class!
  - Shut up!
  - Uh oh... don't turn around...
  - What? Why?
  - Forget it...
- - Since when is she an "actress"?
  - I know, she needs to die immediately.
- - Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
  - How perfect.
  - He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
- - God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
  - Good.
  - God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
- - Hi.
  - Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
  - Why?
  - Just look at them!
- - So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
  - Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
  - Did you sign up yet?
  - Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
  - God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting
    for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's
    such a weird feeling.
  - I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
- - Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
  - We should follow them!
- - Much later.
  - In fact, never.
- - What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
  - You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
  - That lets us off the hook.
- - Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe
    and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
  - Or maybe not.
  - Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
  - Okay, okay!
  - Hey, look at this...
- - '"Authentic 50''s diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950''s?'
  - God, it's so totally pathetic.
- - Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
  - I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
- - Hi, Al!
  - Can we call you "Weird Al"?
- - I might actually get the pasta special.
  - You loser!
- - Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
  - I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
  - What does that even mean?
- - Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
  - God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing
    Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other
    laugh!"
  - You can have that one.
  - Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken?
    Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
  - Gross.
- - 'Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You:
    striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish
    fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy,
    or did we have a moment?"'
  - God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
  - I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
  - We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
  - Oh, we totally have to.
- - Does Oomie really like this show?
  - Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
- - So what should we do?
  - Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
  - What is this?
  - I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward
    past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here
    someplace.
- - Hey - why do you have this?
  - You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
  - I've been looking all over for this.
- - Look at how cute I am!
  - What a little hosebag.
- - Look, that's back when I hated you.
  - I remember every minute of that party.
  - There's my dad with Joanie.
  - I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
  - No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There!
    Look at her!
- - I want to do him!
  - I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always
    go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
  - What are you talking about -- who?
  - That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
  - Fuck you!
- - Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
  - Which loser?
  - You know, the green cardigan guy.
  - Oh yeah.
- - You call.
  - Why do I always have to do it?
  - You're better at it.
  - I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
  - What does it stand for?
  - Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical
    message followed by a faint BEEP.
- - God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
  - I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
  - Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
- - Look, maybe that's him!
  - It's still twenty-five minutes early.
- - I want to "make love" to him.
  - I'm going to tell him you said that.
- - SHUT UP!
  - She says she wants to MMPH!
- - Is he wearing a green cardigan?
  - What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
- - It's obviously him!
  - I can't believe it!
- - What's going on now? What's he doing?
  - Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
- - What's he doing now?
  - He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
- - Do you think he knows?
  - I dunno...
- - Are you sure?
  - Totally! Look!
- - He's insane!
  - We should follow him home.
- - He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
  - I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
  - This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
- - This is way too creepy.
  - He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
  - I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
- - The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
  - Bingo!
- - What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
  - Come on, it's too late now...
- - Ew, look at this...
  - Gross!
  - I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
  - Ew, it's like some gross rat...
- - That was truly pathetic.
  - I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
- - He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these
    apartments are super expensive...
  - It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start
    crying!... Do you think they're gay?
  - What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
  - Oh yeah...
  - He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have
    to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
  - I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really
    hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
  - That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay,
    but there's no kitchen...
  - Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
  - Not really...
  - Forget it, I can't explain it...
- - We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
  - Somewhere downtown.
- - '"Funky"?'
  - What, is she black now?
- - I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and
    convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
  - What are you talking about?
  - That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get
    a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive
    outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
  - You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making
    fun of you.
  - Just promise you'll do it.
  - Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
- - What? How long have you been standing there?
  - Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth
    grade?
  - Fuck you, bitch!
- - We still have to go in there sometime.
  - It's always closed...
  - I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
- - Where are we going?
  - Let's go hassle Josh.
  - '"Hassle"?'
- - There he is...
  - As always.
  - Waiting for the bus that never comes...
  - I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
  - Why don't you ask him.
- - JOSH!
  - JOSH!
- - I'll bet he never jerks off...
  - Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
  - Should we leave a note?
- - Why are we going here? I hate this place.
  - It'll only take a second.
- - What was that all about?
  - It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a
    1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
  - I didn't get it either.
  - Everybody's too stupid!
- - How about this one?
  - Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
- - Ew ... when did you get that?
  - This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
  - God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
- - How about this?
  - Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
- - Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
  - We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before
    I start my stupid job.
  - I know a party we could go to...
  - What? Where?!
  - It's a surprise.
  - I don't believe you.
  - If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll
    go?
- - I totally, totally hate you.
  - Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
- - I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
  - Wait...
- - Give me all your money, bitch!
  - Where did you get that?
  - You won't believe it! Guess!
  - Where?
  - Anthony's II!
  - No way... when?
  - Just now... I went with Seymour.
  - You cunt!
- - That guy is totally amazing.
  - He does that every single day.
- - God, how can you stand all these assholes?
  - I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
  - At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
  - He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally
    lazy!
  - That rules!
  - No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers
    and weirdos.
  - But those are our people...
  - Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
  - I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have,
    all these projects that take up all my time.
  - Like what?
  - Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
  - God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
- - '...you don''t have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we
    can at least start looking for an apartment.'
  - I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure
    or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched
    at constantly.
  - You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
  - Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe
    that's why we spend so much time together.
  - You're gross.  See that guy?
  - Which one?
  - He gives me a total boner!
  - He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
- - You're just jealous.
  - Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy
    likes you better than me!
  - Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
  - That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian
    losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
  - Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
  - '...maybe we should be lesbos...'
  - Get away from me!
- - Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without
    even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
  - Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess...
    I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
  - When are you finally going to get your diploma?
  - I dunno, but next week is my last class...
  - Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we
    first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
  - Wasn't it like eighth grade?
  - Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
  - That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
  - I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick
    Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
  - We were such desperate sluts back then.
- - What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
  - I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another
    job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
- - This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
  - Fuck it. Everything must go!
  - Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
- - What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
  - Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
- - Now are you going to get a regular job?
  - Don't worry.
  - If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten
    bucks for all this stuff.
  - Yeah, thanks.
- - Do you want to do something tonight?
  - I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the
    store! I was going to make him a cake...
  - Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
  - Yeah, I guess... call me...
- - I think one of us should fuck Josh...
  - Go ahead...
  - No, really...
  - God, you're really obsessed...
  - I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
  - I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that
    he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring
    him down to our level and all that...
  - Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
  - No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep
    everything the way it is.
- - Look, we have to get these...
  - I can't afford stuff like this right now.
  - I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't
    these the greatest towels?
  - Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
  - Don't you want nice stuff?
  - I can't imagine spending money on towels.
  - You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back
    when you finally get a job.
  - You're insane.
  - Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
  - What thing?
  - That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
  - Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want
    to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
  - God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
- - Hello?
  - Do you still want to do something tonight?
  - What happened to Seymour?
  - I can't believe it - he actually scored!
  - How repulsive!
  - So should I come over?
  - Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
  - What are you talking about? Who?
  - Just some people from work...
  - I don't believe you.
  - Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you
    tomorrow.
- - Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
  - It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
  - I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
  - Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
  - What? When did you see Josh?!
  - He came into work.
  - Why? What did he say?
  - Nothing.
  - When was this?
  - I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
- - Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
  - Great...
  - What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
  - I said "great"...
  - Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
  - Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole
    in the middle of nowhere"?!
  - There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just
    come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
  - Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
- - You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school
    ended!
  - You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
  - FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
- - Hello?
  - I need to talk to you.
- - I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do
    want to move in with you.
  - I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that
    place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
  - Please let me come with you. Please please please...
  - I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
  - Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
  - But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
  - I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck
    off.
- - So, whaddya think?
  - It's fine.
  - So where's all your stuff?
- - There.
  - That's all you're bringing?
  - I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
  - What time?
  - I dunno...
  - Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have
    to show you something else!
- - Hi.
  - Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're
    all blurry!
  - You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
  - Actually, he's a really nice guy.
- - Do you want anything?
  - Maybe an orange juice.
- - Wow... finally.
  - It just came yesterday...
- - Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
  - Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
  - What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
  - Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
  - I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
- - So Josh...
  - Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
- - That guy rules!
  - Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
  - So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super
    fun!
  - No.
- - Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
  - It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
- - Aren't there a million places like this?
  - This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
  - So, where's "Weird Al"?
  - SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
- - Yeah, right.
  - No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
- - That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
  - In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity
    and violence and cruelty in any form...
  - I figured something like that...
- - Jesus, look at this guy.
  - Oh my God, that's HIM!
- - Forget it.
  - Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
  - No.
  - But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him
    back to his natural habitat...
  - You need counseling.
- - Hi Josh.
  - Hi.
  - I just stopped in to say hi.
  - Yeah, well... hi...
- - Hi... what's up?
  - Can I come in?
- - Are you the one who left that note?
  - I guess.
- - Do you want something to drink?
  - Why?
  - What do you mean "why"?
  - Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
  - Yeah, right...
  - '"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What''s so wrong with me?'
  - Nothing.
  - Then why do you hate me so much?
  - When did I say I hated you?
  - You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
  - You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me
    feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
  - That's just the way I am!
  - Yeah, well --
  - It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
- - You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it
    must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
  - Why do you have that stupid poster?
- - Oh, hi...
  - Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're
    into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
  - How long have you been up?
  - I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
  - Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
  - I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell
    Becky about this.
  - Why not?
  - Because if you do, I'll kill you!
  - Okay... I promise.
  - Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the
    end of it...
- - Hi Enid.
  - Hey Josh.
  - Are you ready to go?
- - I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate
    your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
  - You can count on me, sir!
- - What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
  - Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
  - Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open
    your own theater...
  - But I was only trying to be friendly...
  - Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
  - Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
- - What the hell is wrong with you?!
  - What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
  - Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training
    about upsizing?
  - But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
  - It's not optional!
  - Jesus...
- - And what can you tell us about this...
  - Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
- - Who is this, Enid?
  - It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
  - And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
  - I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
  - I see... interesting...
- - These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything
    to bring to this.
  - Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's
    Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based
    on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed
    over in our culture...
  - Did you actually do this painting?
  - Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
  - And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
  - It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out
    in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
  - And how does an image like this help us to see that?
  - I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it
    seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
- - Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
  - Uh-oh.
  - Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for
    next year?
  - I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
  - Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend
    at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one
    student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well,
    I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
- - Hmm.
  - As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really
    quite an offer...
  - '...wow...'
  - So what do you think?
  - I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
  - Well, yes...
  - I...
  - Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
- - Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
  - What do you mean?
  - The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
  - Huh?
  - Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
  - I didn't check my messages...
  - Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the
    school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to
    help you.
  - Help me what?
  - Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of
    what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to
    get you your diploma in the Fall!
  - But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
  - I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can
    nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can
    --
- - That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
  - Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first
    date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the
    phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
- - Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph
    just heart-rending?
  - Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
  - Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently
    captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio
    that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
  - Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance?
    C'mon!
  - Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
  - Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
  - No, really I --
- - Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to
    make that movie.
  - Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
- - I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director!
    Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
  - Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
  - Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be
    so mean to the skinny one?
- - Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
  - Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
  - Hello...
- - Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
  - Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
  - We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest
    money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through.
    Right, great, sounds good!
- - Hey... so, what brings you down here?
  - I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say...
    I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible
    relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
  - What are you trying to say?
  - It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
- - I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
  - Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
  - Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other...
    she really likes my old records and...
  - I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull
    this kind of shit on me!
- - Have you seen my blue spatula?
  - Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
  - Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
- - Will you get off my back for once?
  - It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
  - Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
  - Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for
    the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part
    time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
  - Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
- - Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
  - Who?
  - Guess.
  - How should I know?
  - Someone from the past.
  - Who?
  - Give up?
  - YES.
  - Maxine.
  - Not the Maxine?
  - Yup.
  - God, how horrifying.
- - Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
  - I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
  - I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
- - I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
  - What is it now?
  - Are you still looking for a job?
  - I guess.
  - Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally
    you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks
    she can convince them.
  - Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
- - Pumpkin? What's wrong?
  - Nothing.
- - It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
  - I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're
    not feeling...
  - What?
  - Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we
    decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at
    the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure
    this is what we want.
- - Pumpkin, are you in there?
  - Are you going to yell at me?
  - About what?
  - Yeah, I heard about that.
  - I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her
    life in a few days.
  - She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She
    says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
  - I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
  - Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is
    on his way up.
  - What do you mean "on his way up"!?
  - I just buzzed him in.
- - What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
  - But I can't --
  - JUST DO IT!
- - I thought you say Tuesday.
  - Better late than never.
  - What's this?
  - You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
  - No, no. You got leak.
  - You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
  - That cost me twenty grand at least.
  - Fifteen, at the most.
  - Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
- - You're kidding, right?
  - You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
- - What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
  - Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
- - As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
  - Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
  - I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
- - These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
  - You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
  - Or what?
- - Greer to Murphy.
  - Go.
- - The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak
    just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it
    before we left Sitka.
  - Of course they did.
  - Let the buyer beware.
  - What do you say, Dodge?
- - Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
  - He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
  - I must be in the wrong business.
  - You got that right.
  - Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
- - Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
  - Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
- - Yeah.
  - There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
- - I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it
    on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
  - Alright. I'll be right up.
- - Too deep to anchor out there.
  - Looks like it's adrift.
- - Call the Coastguard?
  - Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
- - It's funny.
  - How's that?
  - Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
- - Murphy, goddamit.
  - Sorry.
- - Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage
    her.
  - You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
  - We've done it before.
- - All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
  - So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she
    hasn't seen before.
- - Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
  - Yeah.
- - Morning.
  - You're up late.
  - Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
- - How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
  - Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
  - Ho, baby!
- - If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
  - Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come
    looking for.
- - So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
  - We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
- - Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
  - It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
- - I heard that.
  - Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
- - What now?
  - We could call for help.
  - And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
- - Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna
    do with your share, skipper?
  - Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
- - Greer?
  - Moving to Sweden.
- - I don't know.
  - Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
  - Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
- - I say we off-load some of that gold now.
  - Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic
    now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't
    even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays
    where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer
    there than here.
- - Pretty low all around.
  - We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship,
    but it's probably worth looking around.
- - Ho-ly shit.
  - Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
- - Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this
    ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
  - And look what happened.
- - Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
  - Maybe.
- - Never been more thirsty in my life.
  - Drink up then.
- - How're you feeling?
  - Lost my sea legs.
- - What happened?
  - You don't remember?
  - Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging
    around.
  - You've been out for about a day.
  - Say what?
  - Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
- - Oh, man.
  - We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
  - I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
- - We're not gonna be able to pump it!
  - Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
- - We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
  - The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough.
    A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
- - Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
  - Shut up.
  - Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
- - It's a Noaa buoy.
  - A what?
  - Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
- - We're still drifting.
  - The mooring hasn't come taught.
- - He took the shotgun and a light.
  - Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
- - Can't find the shotgun.
  - So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
  - Doesn't look like it much matters.
- - What about the gold?
  - Leave it.
  - Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
  - You think whoever did this is reasonable?
  - All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
- - Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know
    about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving
    your ass down here if it comes to that.
  - Fine with me.
- - Candy?
  - It's my pen name.
- - Go on.
  - Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At
    least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is...
    we split it four ways.
- - The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
  - They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
- - Coffee?
  - Yeah. Thanks.
- - What'd you find up there?
  - Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The
    question is where the hell's she been since.
  - She was sailing up north, right?
  - Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
  - Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck
    in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which
    moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later,
    the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats
    around til somebody runs into her.
- - Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
  - Nope.
  - She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was
    sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the
    crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm
    of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain,
    his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their
    log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in
    the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
  - So what did happen?
  - Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really
    know for sure.
  - You think she's sailing without a crew?
- - I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind
    and the right current.
  - You're more practical than superstitious.
  - Only way to be.
- - Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
  - Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
- - Why not call for help?
  - For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
- - Take it easy, you'll live longer.
  - Did you see him?
  - Who?
  - The guy. He just came this way.
  - What guy?
  - There's somebody else on this boat.
  - What? What the hell're you talking about.
  - I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
  - Are you sure?
  - Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
  - You sure it wasn't me?
  - It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
- - So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
  - We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
- - Guess that'd be me. Again.
  - Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner
    you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
- - No cowboy shit up there, understand?
  - No cowboy shit. Right.
- - Got your light?
  - Yup.
- - Murphy to Epps.
  - Epps.
  - You just shoot at something?
  - Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
- - Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
  - Greer?
  - I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
- - He needs a doctor.
  - I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep
    an eye on him.
- - How's he doing?
  - Same. Any luck?
  - No. I'll try again later.
- - They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved
    of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
  - Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's
    out of the question here.
- - You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
  - If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away
    in the lifeboats.
  - Only something must've gone wrong.
- - The ah... the radio's out.
  - What?
  - Somebody took it out of commission last night.
- - Smashed it up pretty bad.
  - But, who -- ?
- - '"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs
    over fresh kill."'
  - February first.
  - The same day she supposedly went down.
  - Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
- - '"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls
    have been made."'
  - Collision? With what?
  - The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
  - But where's the damage?
  - Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
  - If it was a ship she hit.
- - It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
  - Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
- - It's not gonna hold us.
  - Doesn't matter.
- - Hey.
  - Hey.
  - Couldn't sleep.
  - Wish I could say the same.
- - What do you think happened on this boat?
  - I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
  - The what?
  - Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little
    nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts
    greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is
    anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look
    like the last time.
  - Are we smart enough to avoid that?
  - I don't know, are we?
- - When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
  - Not our mystery guest again.
  - No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
- - What, like some kind of ghost?
  - I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she
    was gone.
- - Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were
    showing me.
  - Showing you what?
  - What happened.
  - Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
  - No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
  - Victims of what?
  - Something bad happened here, Murphy.
  - That much I think we've already established.
  - More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
- - She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't,
    we might never leave.
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  - I don't know.
- - Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
  - Just lucky I guess.
- - Murphy to Epps.
  - Epps, over.
  - Either of you seen Dodge?
- - Nope.
  - He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
- - Epps? You there?
  - Right here.
- - What do we do with him?
  - Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
- - What do you think?
  - Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among
    themselves. "Like wild dogs."
  - Over the gold.
  - Maybe it was more than that.
- - They went crazy.
  - Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
- - Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
  - If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
  - It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far
    as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
- - What happened?
  - We hit land.
  - What?
  - We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
  - Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
- - You killed them.
  - It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming
    as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer
    too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the
    middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't
    think so.
  - So you killed them?
  - The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe
    was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those
    Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit
    friends.
  - And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
  - I didn't want it to turn out this way.
  - Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
  - I think I see it pretty well.
  - It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
  - I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
  - It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever
    does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
  - I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural
    mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes
    down to, pure and simple.
  - I don't give a damn about the gold.
  - I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no
    choice.
- - What's slow?
  - Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
- - Morning everybody.
  - Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
  - Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
  - I bet you did.
- - Could be a fishing boat.
  - Too big. More like a freighter.
- - Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
  - He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
- - You mean, before she sank.
  - Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
- - Then why didn't they take it.
  - Probably didn't have time.
- - Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
  - That's what I call a payday.
  - Hell yeah.
- - That's a good thing?
  - Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
- - What'd he look like?
  - Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him.
    I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
- - Coffee.
  - You're a pal.
- - Stay away. Or else.
  - Because of the gold.
- - Any dizziness?
  - No.
  - Headache, nausea, lights?
  - Lights?
  - Sudden flashes of light.
  - I feel fine.
- - I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
  - Better than starving to death.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
  - What?
  - Nothing. Let's get outa here.
- - I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your
    share.
  - I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for
    the freaky motherfucker did this.
- - You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
  - Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
- - What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's
    not a port for 800 miles.
  - Smugglers maybe.
- - Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea
    and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
  - You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings
    alone could go for a few million.
  - If you get it back in one piece.
  - It's a risk I'm willing to take.
- - It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
  - The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit
    anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
- - With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days
    without another stop.
  - Sounds reasonable.
- - Mother fucker!
  - What is it?
  - Threw a turbine blade.
- - The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
  - How long to fix?
  - Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
- - What's this?
  - Turbine rotor's shot.
  - I thought you said it was just a blade.
  - Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
  - How much longer's that gonna take?
  - Like I always say --
  - I know I know, two ways to do anything --
  - The right way and the wrong way.
  - But how long?
  - Hard to say.
  - We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
  - I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
  - What about running number two by itself?
  - It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with
    it.
  - How long, then?
  - I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
  - How long?
  - Three, four days.
  - Goddamit, Dodge.
  - What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start
    pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
- - Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent
    accurate.
  - Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway.
    I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
- - Went aboard.
  - She take a radio?
- - It's a hell of a lot of money.
  - What, you think there's something funny about it?
  - A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to
    care enough to come looking for it?
- - Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest
    of the boat.
  - Then it happened before they scuttled her.
- - Or somebody stopped them.
  - Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
- - So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
  - A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself.
    It's ours.
  - Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
  - It looks like it.
- - You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million
    bucks?
  - So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
- - Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
  - The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
- - I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men
    through the Puget.
  - How about you Epps?
- - Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
  - Yeah, yeah.
- - Sounds like the hull.
  - Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
- - If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
  - Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
  - Not in the eyes of the law.
- - I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our
    business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
  - And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
  - Why not? Why the fuck not?
- - What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
  - We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
- - If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to
    re-consider our options.
  - Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
- - Bodies're too fresh.
  - Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
- - Damn barbaric is what it is.
  - Could be meant as a warning.
- - That'd be my guess.
  - So whoever did this might still be around.
- - Can't you use something else?
  - I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
  - Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
  - Right.
- - Dodge to Murphy.
  - Murphy.
  - You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
  - What is it?
  - I think you better see this for yourself.
- - It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it
    didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
  - Not me.
- - On a passenger ship in 1953?
  - If they knew what they were carrying.
- - So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call
    the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
  - How do you mean?
  - Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies.
    About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
  - I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
  - Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million
    dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
  - What do you propose?
  - For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't
    gonna bother them.
- - There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard
    here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
  - With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to
    have a little say in what happens to it.
- - Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
  - I don't know what you're talking about?
  - I think you know.
  - Maybe you can tell me then.
- - The radio!
  - The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
- - Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
  - You smashed it!
  - What?!
  - Don't lie to me!
  - What the fuck -- ?
  - You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
  - I didn't touch the fucking radio.
- - I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on
    that boat, skipper?
  - Conveniently enough for you.
  - Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
- - Yeah.
  - You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
- - What the hell happened!
  - Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
- - That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
  - If money can buy what he wants.
  - I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
  - Then you're a lucky man.
- - We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
  - Right.
- - Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies
    below decks for bait.
  - There's a charming thought.
- - You're late.
  - Sorry.
  - Don't fall asleep.
  - Right.
- - Where from?
  - Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's
    a problem.
- - One more?
  - Why not.
- - What is your first name?
  - What?
  - It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't
    know it.
- - Maureen.
  - What?
  - Maureen.
  - Maureen?
- - Roger.
  - Roger?
  - Yeah.
- - You think that's funny
  - No.
- - Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
  - Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane
    harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
  - Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
- - Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds,
    it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
  - Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
  - Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
- - Ready?
  - Bring it on, dude.
- - Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
  - Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
- - If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we
    just hit the jackpot.
  - Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat.
    It's either sunk or it ain't.
- - Last thing we want is extra partners.
  - Or uninvited guests.
- - This's gonna hurt a little.
  - Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
- - What other choices have we got?
  - I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
- - Guess I'll just keep working.
  - What're you crazy?
  - I like my job.
- - Light in those passages ain't so good.
  - I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
- - Maybe that is his boat.
  - Gimme a break.
- - Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from
    us? One guy?
  - So we kill him?
  - I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
- - One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
  - Maybe he isn't alone.
- - Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
  - Seen a lota movies.
- - Smokes?
  - Oh yeah.
- - I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
  - A what?
  - I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils
    are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up
    there?
  - I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some
    kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
- - Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on
    the outside.
  - Then what the hell happened to him?
- - Try Wednesday.
  - Right. Wednesday.
- - Did you?
  - Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
- - What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
  - Why not?
- - Dodge.  Dodge.
  - What?
  - Get up.
  - Yeah, yeah.
- - Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
  - I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
- - Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
  - With that coxswain dickhead.
- - Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody
    wants it back?
  - They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
  - I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
- - You think the extra strain caused it?
  - Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
- - How about now?
  - Sixty pounds.
  - What? You sure?
  - That's what it says.
  - Lemme see.
- - Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
  - Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't
    think that's just a little freaky?
- - Fucker!
  - Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
  - Damn mind of it's own.
  - Morning, skipper.
- - One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place
    is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
  - Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
- - What's so great about Sweden?
  - It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
- - Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
  - We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
- - Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself,
    that's for damn sure.
  - She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never
    know it.
- - Let's not be too hasty.
  - Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call
    this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
- - I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel,
    about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
  - I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
  - You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
- - What day is it?
  - I don't know. Tuesday?
  - Wrong. It's Friday.
- - When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's
    legal.
  - Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
- - The turbine blew.
  - Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
- - You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
  - After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.

- - Karen. Wow. Look at you...
  - Hello, Martin.
- - I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks,
    of memories.  Of us.
  - Really.
  - Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
  - '''It'' didn''t slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki
    in the middle of my birthday party.'
- - Oh, for Christ's sake -
  - I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The
    acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
- - Lufkin. His... agent.
  - Yeah, Karen knows him.
  - But you are interested?
  - I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again,
    the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different
    levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?
- - Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
  - Thanks.
- - I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping
    with.
  - And after all, you have such morals.
- - Which two?
  - Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it
    not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
  - Mob guy?
- - I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting
    the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping
    it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
  - What money?
  - The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know,
    till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
  - Shylock?
- - What's wrong?
  - Be quiet and listen.
  - I don't hear anything.
- - When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off
    the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could
    sleep in the maid's room.
  - Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on
    the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it,
    turned the TV back on.
  - I don't have a dog.
  - You don't? What happened to Muff?
  - Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
- - Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
  - Harry -
  - I'm going.
- - How did you get in the house?
  - He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell
    Karen, let's see what she thinks.
  - Maybe you didn't hear me.
- - That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week.
    Harry must've been busy.
  - That's where you got the idea?
- - With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
  - Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
  - Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
  - No problem. You go on off to bed.
- - What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
  - Oh, yeah, sure.
- - Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
  - He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of
    agreement I want.
- - Harry, we spoke with Martin.
  - '''We?'''
  - Chili and me.
- - Harry -
  - Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
- - Hello, Doris.
  - Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
- - Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
  - Come on in.
- - What a spectacular view.
  - Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner
    of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
- - I miss Murray, Harry.
  - Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him.
    Made him what he was.
  - What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm
    being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't
    know it until too late.
- - I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
  - You seem to feel fine about it.
  - I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
  - Murray's dead.
- - So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
  - No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount
    the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
  - Yeah, what'd he have to say?
  - He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But
    don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
  - How honorable of you.
- - Yeah, but whose point of view?
  - Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
  - Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk
    to Martin?
- - All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the
    emotion of the scene.
  - What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
  - She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your
    time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
- - Yeah? What three words, Harry?
  - Pick 'n' Save.
  - Hm?
  - You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
- - So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just
    love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the
    way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look
    that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That
    look was so... romantic.'
  - That's great, Harry. So what's the --
  - What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera
    so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she
    remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we
    can see them.
- - They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
  - Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
  - What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
- - Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
  - What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about
    no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna
    give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
- - You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
  - That's what the guy said.
  - Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need
    the coat.
- - Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated
    and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting
    his time and we don't need that.
  - Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
- - No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says
    most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
  - That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
  - In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my
    hat down.
- - I told you not to -
  - Don't say a fuckin' word.
- - I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that
    time.
  - You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
  - No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
  - You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your
    brain is one fuckin' thing.
  - All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know
    where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
  - How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
  - He already knew it.
  - Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
  - Whatta you doing out there?
  - I'm going into the movie business.
  - What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
  - I'm thinking about producing.
  - How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
  - I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
  - Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
- - The door from the patio, in back.
  - You broke in?
  - No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
  - What if it was?
- - Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks
    behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
  - I know what a vig is.
- - The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
  - That's right. Three percent.
  - But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
  - A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for
    five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
  - A real bargain.
- - A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her
    how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement,
    the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest
    of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving
    him about ten years.
  - How much is the wife offered?
- - Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
  - What're you doing here?
  - I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
  - Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
  - No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice
    things you got around here.
  - Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
  - Rough day on the set?
  - I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was
    ripping my nylons -
  - Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
  - '...That''s what we finally decided.'
  - Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
- - You saw that one?
  - Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth
    is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best
    day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way
    was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had
    in that look.
  - Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
  - For any movie.
  - I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around
    in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
  - Man, can you scream.
  - Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to
    get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture,
    "Cabin in the..."
  - '"Cotton".'
  - Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty
    look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
- - How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
  - I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
  - You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
  - He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
  - That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his
    movie?
  - Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the
    ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
  - Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
  - Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when
    the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
  - Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
  - Don't go out of your way.
- - Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
  - Right. See how your story ends.
  - Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check
    it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
- - You been here the whole time?
  - I just caught the end.
- - I got you a copy of the script.
  - I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
  - What do you think?
- - I think it's not horrible.
  - I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
  - Then you've read it?
  - Not yet.
  - You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
  - There a part in it for you?
  - I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help
    him get Martin.
  - Sounds fair.
  - What do you get out of it?
- - That why you came over here, to ask me that?
  - I want to know.
  - Why does anyone want to be in movies?
  - Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
- - I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad
    enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when
    they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
  - And you think the movie business is any different?
  - Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what
    you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound
    too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
- - This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn
    chair on Sunset...
  - You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
- - Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
  - Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
- - A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
  - The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you
    back.
- - That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
  - Depends, who pays?
  - Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea
    what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even
    know their own phone number.
- - How'd you meet Martin anyway?
  - Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
  - I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
  - You don't like Martin much, do you?
  - Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all,
    but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
  - For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
- - So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
  - How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
  - How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
  - That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the
    visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
- - Yeah?
  - Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
  - Really.
- - I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show
    it.
  - You thought I was faking?
  - No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
  - Oh.
- - You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
  - Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
- - I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe
    do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like
    say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to
    take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
  - Hey, Chili? Look at me.
- - Harry... My God...
  - What happened?
- - What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
  - Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
- - Why not?
  - Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think
    of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
- - Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
  - Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
- - You sure?
  - He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
  - It's not Dave. It's a movie.
  - Are you going down?
  - I don't know.
  - You're as bad as Harry...
  - I'll go. I'll go.
- - You okay?
  - Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
- - Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
  - Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
- - Were you scared up there?
  - You bet.
  - You don't act like it?
  - I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
- - I'll be right back.
  - Go get your stuff.
- - What took you so long?
  - Couldn't find my toothbrush.
- - It's not one of these?
  - You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in
    Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
  - Maybe you don't see my sign?
- - We call you a taxi.
  - Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an
    expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new
    one? Is that what you're telling me?
  - Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
  - I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
- - I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet,
    underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
  - I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
  - You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
  - They report it to the IRS.
  - You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever
    you want.
- - You've been losing.
  - I'm up twelve grand today.
  - From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
  - Who told you that?
  - Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since
    you got here.
  - How'd you know I was here?
  - Here's another tip...
- - It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history,
    for Christ's sake?
  - I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your
    ass.
  - How? By taking my money?
  - You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
  - It's all mine.
  - Sit down, Leo.
- - You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
  - At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
- - But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
  - I'll find you, Leo...
- - Yeah. That was a good party.
  - You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
  - Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center,
    the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
- - Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better
    I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I
    never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the
    way finks act.
  - A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you
    guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your
    rhythms of speech.
  - We talk different?
  - It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain
    confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional
    views.
  - You mean like we don't give a shit.
  - Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms,
    man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside
    their heads.
- - So you don't know what I'm thinking.
  - No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
  - So you want to know.
  - If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
  - I'm thinking of a movie.
  - One of mine?
  - One we're producing.
  - With what? Wiseguy money?
- - Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a
    loanshark Operation in Miami.
  - What happened? The pressure got to you?
  - Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
- - Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I
    do?
  - Martin, look at me.
  - I'm looking at you.
- - No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes,
    'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
  - Like this?
  - What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
  - Wait. How about this?
  - Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
- - How about this?
  - That's not bad.
  - That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
  - I believe it.
  - I turn it on when I confront the guy.
  - Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
  - How do I know that?
- - The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
  - Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
- - So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
  - It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along,
    a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account
    of a past situation.
  - Okay. I'm listening.
- - At that point, basically, that has to be it.
  - You're not going to tell me the rest?
- - Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
  - Buddy?
- - Very nice...
  - Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac
    of minivans.
  - What's that?
  - Compass.
  - Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
- - Whatta you think, Chill?
  - That's not bad. I think you got it down.
- - You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
  - Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys
    can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
- - You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
  - He died.
  - How'd you know he died, he tell you?
- - Yeah, he told me.
  - Personally?
  - Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet
    went down last month.
  - What Get Away jet?
  - It was in the Herald.
  - Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
  - Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning
    business out on Federal Highway.
- - Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you
    start affording me the proper respect.
  - '''E.g.'' means ''for example'', Ray. I think what you wanna say is ''i.e.'''
  - Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
  - Ask your man here.
- - You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another,
    uhh...
  - Twenty seven hundred.
  - Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give
    a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
- - Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
  - Where you been, Harry?
- - Have we met? I don't recall.
  - We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
- - Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
  - You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been
    up to.
- - I'm looking at you.
  - I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
  - That's what I'm doing.
  - You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
  - Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
  - We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty
    days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
- - Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
  - Harry, lemme give you some advice.
- - A marker's like a check, Harry.
  - I know what a marker is.
  - They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your
    dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you
    never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks
    me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window
    with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque,
    except she's not blond anymore...
- - You're not looking at me, Harry.
  - Why do I have to keep looking at you?
  - I want you to.
  - You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
  - Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you,
    uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
  - Fuckin' basketball game.
- - You make movies, huh?
  - I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened
    to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of
    my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
- - Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
  - Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
- - You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out
    of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
  - You just did.
  - I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story
    line develops.
- - It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
  - Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's
    in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it
    to make money.
- - Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
  - That's right. As a matter of fact...
- - Keep going.
  - Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
- - So he comes to L.A...
  - I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But,
    yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
- - That's it? That's your movie?
  - I said I had an idea, that's all.
  - That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You
    don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize
    with, you don't have a good guy.
  - The shylock's the good guy.
  - The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get
    a settlement that fast.
- - Part of it, yeah.
  - Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
  - You mean, Leo?
  - You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
  - I'm not the guy, Harry.
  - But you work for the casino?
  - I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend,
    Dick Allen.
  - So you don't work for the casino?
- - Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
  - What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna
    do next.
- - I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know,
    say one of your customers stopped paying.
  - They always paid.
- - You pack a gun?
  - Not really.
  - What does that mean?
  - Maybe a few times I have.
  - Ever shot anybody.
  - Once.
  - Really? You ever been arrested?
  - I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never
    convicted. I'm clean.
  - Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
- - These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put
    money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on
    another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be
    my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the
    country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound
    fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
  - Harry, look at me.
- - You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's
    hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred
    grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told
    'em about it. Why not?
  - Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding
    or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
  - You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their
    money to Vegas to begin with?
  - Because I need half a million to buy a script.
  - For a movie?
  - A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving
    Miss Daisy".
  - What's it called?
  - '"Mr. Lovejoy".'
  - '"Mr. Lovejoy"? That''s the title?'
  - It's not bad when you know what it's about.
- - Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer
    for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested,
    would I produce it.
  - Who's the star?
- - Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
  - Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
  - One of his best parts.
  - No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
  - '"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.'
- - She looks familiar.
  - She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast.
    He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west
    so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
- - Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's
    shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's
    trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
  - So what's the problem?
  - The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting
    down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
  - He drown?
  - Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
- - Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray
    and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
  - So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if
    he wants to invest his money in a movie.
  - That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin
    -
  - I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
  - Just a thought.
  - But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make
    the point in a way they'd understand it.
  - You don't even know these guys.
  - Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
  - What do you get out of this?
  - Let's see how we get along.
- - Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his
    video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
  - Read it. It's a grabber.
- - No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't
    introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em
    when they sit down.
  - They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
  - That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand,
    Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
- - You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped
    by, so I can set you straight.'
  - You're kidding, right?
- - What?
  - I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth
    shut.
  - I had to tell 'em something.
  - Never say anything unless you have to.
- - You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying
    yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin'
    ears.
  - I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
  - That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something
    from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir.
    I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
  - His shrink's trainer.
- - How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
  - Hey, Harry.
  - Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
- - Here's your keys, Harry.
  - Get the fuck outta my chair.
- - Is he giving you a check or cash?
  - Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
- - Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
  - I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
- - Really.
  - Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
  - A meeting with who? You and Karen?
- - So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally
    help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
  - I found him.
- - Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
  - You have it?
  - Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then
    you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
  - Who?
  - Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
  - Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
  - Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check
    it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
- - Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest
    in my movie.
  - Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme
    the key.
- - Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked
    one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
  - Leo spanked a waitress?
  - Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies
    with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My
    guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
- - Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
  - What've you got?
  - Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
  - Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
- - You live in Miami?
  - That's right.
  - What're you doing in Los Angeles?
  - I'm in the movie business.
  - You're an investor, is that it?
  - I'm a producer.
  - You have a card in here?
  - Not yet. I just started.
- - Your wife a Lakers fan?
  - I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
- - By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
  - It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking
    for anyway, a bomb or something?
  - Something shouldn't be there.
  - Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe
    you'll find it.
  - That's the idea. I'll think about it.
  - That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
  - Get him out've here.
- - Who the fuck are you?
  - Ray Barboni. From Miami.
  - What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
- - The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
  - He owes me money.
  - Get in line, bro.
  - I don't like waiting.
  - Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
  - Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
- - You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt
    like that.
  - Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always
    jammin' at the wrong time.
- - How'd you get in here?
  - I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
  - So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
  - Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
- - Why would I do that?
  - '''Cause the guy''s a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.'
- - I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
  - Yeah? Which terminal?
  - Sovereign.
  - You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker,
    ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
  - I like it here.
- - Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit
    from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over
    some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right?
    Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's
    strictly between you and me, right?
  - Whatever you want, Ray.
- - Ray Barboni?
  - Who is this?
  - Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
  - Depends. Who's this?
  - Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who
    I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
  - What three hundred grand?
  - The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three
    hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
- - Hello? You there?
  - Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit
    or not for real.
  - Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
  - Okay. So who are you?
  - I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
  - Who?
  - Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
  - Never heard of him.
  - Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's
    time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
- - So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking
    about here?
  - Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
  - Or else what?
  - Or else use your fucking imagination.
- - Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
  - Ray. Look at me.
- - What?
  - Look at me, Ray.
  - You say look at you?
  - That's correct. Look at me.
- - I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
  - What I been wondering is where's he been.
  - Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
- - Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming
    in on this new one.
  - By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
- - You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
  - I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it
    all in Harry's movie.
  - What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
- - Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes
    no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty
    points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
  - I can't do it.
  - You positive about that?
  - It's a different kind of deal.
- - Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
  - You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
  - I'm working on a few things.
  - Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
  - Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
- - Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
  - Chili Palmer showed you my script?
  - Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
- - Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You
    pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
  - You serious?
  - All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some
    ideas on how to fix it up.
- - How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
  - You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
  - We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili
    Palmer.
- - He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this
    dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
  - Leo, I don't know.
- - Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
  - Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those
    jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
  - The airport.
  - It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you
    don't want to know about.
- - I don't know.
  - It's not the kind of thing you do.
- - C-18.
  - That's the magic number.
- - What's this movie you're doing first?
  - Harry, let me answer that.
- - But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking
    to him?
  - You can talk to me.
  - That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
- - You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding
    on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
  - That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away
    from you.
- - I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the
    place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
  - I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
- - Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name
    or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
  - It's what he said, I'm his associate.
  - You must bring something heavy to the deal.
  - That's right, me.
- - Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
  - Yeah, we're getting Martin.
  - No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
  - I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin'
    dead.' Like that.
  - I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The
    man could do it in his sleep.
  - Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
  - I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
  - Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
  - So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs,
    man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it,
    play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
- - Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's
    name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
  - I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase
    the romance angle.
- - There's Ilona.
  - What about her?
  - Get something going there.
  - With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
  - She's... young.
  - Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she
    calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
  - Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be
    able to get Karen Flores.
  - Who?
  - She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
- - You know how to write one of these?
  - There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say.
    Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you
    aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky
    words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and
    there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important.
    Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end,
    you're done.
  - That's all there is to it, huh?
  - That's all.
- - I really think I can be of service on this one.
  - Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
- - I need the money.
  - What money?
  - The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
  - Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for
    three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
- - I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked
    up your organization is.
  - Tell you what...
- - How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the
    wall back there. One...
  - What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
  - In just a second. Two...
  - I don't believe this.
  - Three.
- - Karen? You okay?
  - She can't talk right now.
- - That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
  - Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
  - Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
- - You know Laurel Canyon?
  - I'll find it.
  - I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
  - Gimme an hour.
- - Where's Karen?
  - In the can. That the money?
- - She's great. Gimme the money.
  - First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
- - You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
  - What?
- - Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
  - It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio
    Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both.
    He played John Wayne.
  - Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
  - Bear, you're not really gonna -
- - Where is my nephew?
  - Your who?
  - Yayo. Where is he?
- - He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard.
    I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
  - Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
  - He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand
    dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all
    the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking
    money.
  - Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
  - You gave him the money?
  - I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
  - Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
  - Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
  - A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
- - Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
  - Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
  - He's around someplace.
  - I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for
    five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think
    maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
- - You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
  - I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton.
    We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular.
    After, we'll come here, get our money.
- - I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the
    other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
  - So you didn't have the key with you.
  - You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it
    has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
  - You spotted them, huh?
- - What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
  - I have to ask you for that key.
  - What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
  - Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
  - You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
- - Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point
    a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from
    the car.
  - I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
- - What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right?
    A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
  - Not too bad.
  - How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
- - I think I pulled my quadriceps.
  - So... how many movies you been in?
  - About sixty.
  - No shit? What're some of 'em?
- - Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
  - You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
  - You see that? The way the man just went right over?
- - Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
  - Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
- - And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me,
    not Chili Palmer.
  - Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
  - Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
  - They all sound big at the talking stage.
- - He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
  - So where's the money?
  - I guess still in the locker.
  - You guess? You mean you don't know?
  - I mean I don't care.
- - You see the paper?
  - I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to
    the chest and one through his foot.
  - His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
  - Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
- - Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I
    want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
  - I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
  - Who?
  - Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit.
    I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
  - Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
  - Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat.
    I'm done.
  - Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That
    ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
  - That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
- - He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West
    Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
  - Come here, Farrah...
- - I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the
    glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
  - Farrah. Come here.
- - After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to
    each other.
  - Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the
    three hundred grand from the airline?
  - What about him?
  - I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while
    I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
  - And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores'
    undie drawer? What then?
  - Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
- - You get the money?
  - No. What's this?
  - Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
- - Trade for what?
  - The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
- - You get life for kidnapping.
  - Calm down, Bear...
  - Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
- - Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot
    the fuckin' president?
  - Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a
    room fulla felons.
- - And that's for the airport.
  - Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
  - We'll get it later.
- - You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore,
    he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
  - You're right.
- - What is this?
  - An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
  - I reserved a Cadillac.
  - Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
  - You're kidding me, right?
  - Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are
    Rabbit convertibles.
- - The land here is best for grain and corn.
  - Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
- - My daughter, I ask only...
  - This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt
    till now.
- - For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's
    damned humiliating.
  - Juba was a Numidian.
  - He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
- - William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
  - Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
- - You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio
    Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
  - That land belongs to the strongest.
- - All people have rights!
  - Just because they are born?
  - Yes!
  - Who says so?
  - I say!
  - I see...
  - And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
  - 'Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why
    I don''t trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches,
    print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction,
    Mister Adams, it''s us.  And, I don''t believe you can ever change human nature.'
- - You hear that?
  - 'That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world''s dregs.'
  - Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The
    world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming,
    you will betray them.
- - Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
  - God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really
    got one it scares you more than it does the British!
- - Where... do those men come from, George?
  - Africa, of course.
  - Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
  - Slavers capture them and bring them here.
  - Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
  - Sally, our slave system is a British law...
- - The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small'
    or 'orderly'.
  - Or, 'civilized'.
  - In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
- - Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
  - That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of
    courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
- - What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
  - It's stupid, of course.
- - Then why are you teaching me...?
  - Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners,
    philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
- - 'I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular
    city on earth.'
  - The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt
    it.
  - I think America suits you.
- - Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children
    in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
  - It's the freest land on earth.
  - Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
  - Well, we must be who we must be...
- - And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
  - What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I
    must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford
    to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone
    laughs at me.
- - I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never,
    ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent
    at hiding your feelings.
  - I think I will disappoint you.
- - What are you doing?
  - Let's get you darker!
  - You're out of your mind!
  - Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
  - They can use their imaginations.
  - Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
- - I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that
    lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints,
    and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
  - I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
  - And dost thou live to ask it?
- - Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established
    authorities are wrong."
  - That's good... who?
  - Voltaire, of course...
- - So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William
    claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales
    about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
  - George, I'm sorry.
  - Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main
    job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out
    of you.
  - That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her,
    George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
- - We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get
    a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
  - Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
  - Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as
    her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
- - Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real
    world.
  - Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't
    that right?
- - Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown
    children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another
    thing to prove yourself.
  - You know very well who it is that I love.
  - Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
- - George, you know I only love you, but...
  - But not more than your comfort.
  - And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or
    is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious
    in war!?
  - That's a lie!
  - Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll
    clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial
    yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream
    come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
  - Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how
    poor I really am.
  - Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for
    a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off
    your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get
    what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
  - I'd throw everything away for you.
- - You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
  - I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
  - Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just
    another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
  - Really?  Which precious homily was it?
  - '"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."'
- - We can't take them.  Are you all right?
  - We're leaving them?
  - They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General
    Greene, now you do yours!
  - Yessir!
- - Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
  - Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
  - I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
  - It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did
    you hurt your leg, in a fight?
  - I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with
    them because my pike would always sway...
- - But, you do come from a military family?
  - I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As
    was I.
- - A horseshoer?
  - Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And
    I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you
    the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
- - The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes
    each!
  - Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly
    for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
  - Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these
    men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
  - Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
- - I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a
    gentleman.
  - You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
- - General Greene?
  - I'm with Captain Hamilton.
  - Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
- - They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
  - You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
- - Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean,
    why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're
    a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
  - You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
  - No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common
    man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what
    of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about
    compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has
    no hope.
  - I will not betray you, Nathanael.
  - But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
- - At one time I could have chosen not to be.
  - Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
- - What the hell are we doing?
  - You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys,
    I'm here!
- - Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis,
    you must go with him.
  - I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
- - Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own
    dress uniform...
  - They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning
    to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men
    who look like me, don't you think?
  - Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
- - Well, this must be about something!
  - It is; we need you George.
- - If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect
    you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
  - You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
- - It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
  - My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
  - Surely you knew this was coming.
  - War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was
    probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
- - Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
  - But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
  - Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
  - My God, what?
  - 'The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a
    very real expectation.'
- - Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount
    Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
  - I'm very aware of that.
  - I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership
    has elevated, to be destroyed...
  - Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
  - Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way,
    all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy
    us as surely as a British victory.
- - The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg
    on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The
    only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks
    he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have
    to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every
    one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
  - And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
  - Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western
    lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves
    than we need, but we need more land.
- - But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
  - You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
- - '"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That''s from Cato... you know, that play about
    the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking
    about the old days...'
  - When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
  - When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite
    it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart...
    Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
  - That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
- - That's right...
  - And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors
    getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe
    she always looked down on us.
- - Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute
    separation of state from the church?
  - I think I heard that.
  - It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
  - What else?  From Virginia?
  - Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
- - Martha... what?
  - Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's
    a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected
    you would look out for our interests.
  - To win this war I need an army.
  - Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They
    beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those
    things we cherish!?
  - What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
  - Some things must never change.
  - Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
  - Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of
    our kind...
  - Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and
    they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course
    Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper
    class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if
    they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are
    fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own
    this country too!
- - Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is
    mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible
    to distinguish them.
  - Martha!  For God's sake!
  - Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
  - Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
- - Not today.
  - I want you to see our hospital.
  - I don't want to see your hospital.
- - However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative
    of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with
    our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of
    England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
  - We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
  - But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
- - Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait
    of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just
    before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
  - 'What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?'
- - Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general
    by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.
    General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen,
    and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
  - Uh... none just now, but...
- - '''Continentals'', Congress'' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but
    as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you
    tell which one is fake?'
  - I... they look both the same.
  - The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
- - No, please; an advance on your salary.
  - Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving
    without salary.
  - You must be very rich.
  - I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your
    charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I
    expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
  - '''Charming little victories?'' Please don''t expect much more of us, Monsieur.'
  - I only meant...
  - These supplies...?
  - Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
  - And how rusty are these muskets?
  - Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a
    gift from the people of France!
- - Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile,
    please, take your pick of a horse.
  - I rode here, on my horse.
  - Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
- - Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be
    smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
  - Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
- - Like flowers after the snow melts.
  - When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will
    be bright red British soldiers.
- - What is it, Marquis?
  - My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
- - My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
  - General Lee, sir!
  - Get these men back in line!
- - I feel the same, sir.
  - I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
- - Any word from Canada?
  - Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake
    Champlain...
  - A fleet?
- - My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
  - What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
- - 'If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold
    on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow,
    in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.'
  - I understand, George.
- - Colonel Reed...
  - George!  So good to be back!
- - That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous
    and completely unacceptable.
  - Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together
    a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion
    he saved my army.
  - Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction
    of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
- - A grand scheme?
  - A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
  - No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
  - To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This
    shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand
    that!
- - What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're
    all Christians...
  - I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben
    Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
  - No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
- - But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed
    them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
  - They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on
    Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
  - George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation
    as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes
    of Hamilton and Arnold...
  - How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he
    fights!
  - And, Hamilton?  Greene?
  - They help me understand why we fight.
  - Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the
    best interest of the country first in your mind!
  - Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With
    regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
- - Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old
    court-martial against General Arnold.
  - The man is a traitor!
  - How can you say that?
- - Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this
    war!
  - Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
  - Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on
    Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own
    two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack
    of greedy pigs!
- - I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
  - If he isn't, then he's stupid.
- - Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
  - These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
- - No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out
    of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost,
    then retire to protect Congress.
  - I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York --
    why won't he come on!?
  - General Lee is detained captain...
  - Detained by what?
  - The British army, sir!
  - The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must
    be something else that detains General Lee.
- - Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
  - We already have black soldiers in our army...
  - Unofficially, General Greene.
  - What's the difference?
- - Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
  - He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth
    than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been
    preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston
    Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
  - 'Hancock led the Boston ''tea party'' because he''s a goddamned tea smuggler!  He
    wasn''t protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen
    to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will
    not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And,
    if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!'
- - Let's not over do it...
  - I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion
    of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating
    Congress!
  - Makes you gag.
  - Gag on your own invention, then.
  - Oh, come now...
  - You invented this, this...
- - You think that?
  - He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king
    in the minds of the people!
- - No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and,
    God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
  - Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want
    more and more.  More ale, here!
  - Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another
    leader over Washington?
- - Partially...
  - It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
- - Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
  - Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
- - With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British,
    your opinion counts.
  - As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
- - You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
  - 'I don''t know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two
    different things.  And, if he''s popular with his men...'
- - Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous
    reputation.
  - I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
- - If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills
    so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second
    in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
  - Lafayette is a child!
  - Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all
    mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have
    let me down.
- - George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
  - Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and
    will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening
    here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
  - They are... friends of Congress.
  - Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
- - Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
  - Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
  - The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With
    one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too
    dumb to see it.
  - Who's in command out there?
  - Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
  - George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
- - Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
  - Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
  - We've got powder but no ball!
  - Then use rocks!
- - How old are you, Captain?
  - I'll be twenty next year, sir.
  - I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake,
    have a bath.
  - Delighted, sir.
- - Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
  - No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote
    and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
  - Therefore, retreat.
- - I'm so inclined.
  - Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted
    to hear.
- - General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal'
    with England?
  - And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
- - Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy
    if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
  - With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
  - That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
  - 'But it''s what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but
    one life to give to my country."'
- - They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed
    recruits, just professional killers.
  - It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
- - I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
  - To learn to shoot cannon?
- - Are you going to keep him, sir?
  - We better, Congress invented him.
- - It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop
    geese from migrating.
  - They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then,
    they start coming back to us.
- - What are we going to do?
  - Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned
    fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
- - General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
  - Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I
    don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
- - Yessir.
  - Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most
    of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize
    what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
- - Sir, I think no such thing.
  - Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
  - Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
  - I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
  - I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell
    me so, we part!
- - What is this?
  - Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers
    pensions.
- - This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
  - No one knows...
- - George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
  - To hell with Arnold...
  - He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even
    if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself
    king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place
    you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
  - Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated
    if I don't agree?
- - What's your advice, Alexander?
  - March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators,
    who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
- - I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange
    it at the mess?
  - Yes, I believe so.
  - Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will
    give them my decision then.
- - Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional
    Convention?
  - I'm not sure.
  - George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you
    won't betray them.
  - But it's more than just that, am I right?
- - That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who
    has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
  - You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over
    subjects?
- - General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
  - More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
- - I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
  - Lafayette will not be happy...
- - What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
  - The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
  - What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen
    more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
- - Who is that!?
  - That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
  - Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
- - No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
  - No, my lord.
  - What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots
    at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here
    in?
  - Yes, my lord.
  - And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
  - Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
- - Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's
    that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
  - Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My
    lord.
  - By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
  - I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
- - Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
  - Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
- - You, you just need a new flint, General.
  - You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
  - Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
  - None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
  - Well... I misunderstood, then.
- - Misunderstood what!?
  - A lot of years have gone by.
  - What?  What are you talking about?
  - That you would have known you can trust me.
- - Me?  You apologizing to me?
  - Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
- - Wil...
  - Yes, general?
  - You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard
    about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your
    freedom, after this battle is fought.
  - Yes, general.
  - Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
  - No.  I guess.
  - You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount
    Vernon as long as you want...
- - Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
  - I ain't forgot about the freedom.
- - Well, what have you thought?
  - Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade...
    and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
- - We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we
    have an army yet?  What is happening?
  - Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations
    on your victory at Ticonderoga...
- - I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't
    do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack
    us in the spring.
  - You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
  - Over three hundred miles.
  - You seem pleased by the prospect.
  - Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum
    to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
- - What's your frank estimation of the British?
  - Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they
    then?
  - 'They died well.  Otherwise, they didn''t do much right.  But if we have war,
    the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other
    enemies.'
  - And a French alliance?
  - Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and
    short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment...
    could they beat the British?
  - It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe;
    if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them,
    perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
- - Arnold!
  - I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
- - Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that
    the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is
    back in Canada.
  - Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting
    for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams
    voted against it...
  - Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After
    all you've done, it's unbelievable!
  - Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
  - They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
  - But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious
    battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if
    you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
- - We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need
    Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In
    my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
  - The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander
    and chief.
- - Go on... I want to hear everything.
  - Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
  - Is that a fact.
  - It is.
- - What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
  - Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
- - The army needs you.
  - The army can survive without me.
  - Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope
    at all.
  - 'Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what
    Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero
    was right:  was is ''a time when the laws are silent''.'
  - I hope I never have to believe that.
  - Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking
    you.  Your own aide!
- - After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate
    asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly
    the world -- are sitting at this table...
  - We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer,
    Benedict, before this?
  - Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
- - Well, George, who were you?
  - I?  You all know my history.
- - Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
  - While they're strung out?
  - Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the
    line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
- - They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready
    for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats...
    we desperately need food.
  - Same old story.
- - There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally
    responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of
    America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
  - That can't be.
  - There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
  - Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still
    be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you
    moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander
    and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need
    to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some
    Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
  - As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me
    this winter.
  - There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
- - Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
  - I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
  - 'The point being:  he''s also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off,
    maybe I can restore their faith in me.'
- - That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The
    man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates'
    their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
  - Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
- - They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting
    profits!  It's becoming the American way!
  - You go too far, Benedict.
- - These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which
    Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
  - Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict,
    trust me to handle this.
- - Some say that Hessians are invincible.
  - They always say that.
- - Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
  - Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
  - I wish she was beneath me.
- - Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress
    to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally...
    Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
  - What does she see in them?
- - I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
  - Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market
    goods -- probably their whores!
- - Continue forward, sir?
  - Patience, Lt. . Patience.
- - Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing
    across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction.
    Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
  - The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
- - Find them.
  - But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
  - Find them.
- - 'enerao, I''ve host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru-
    ~ait. There they are'
  - Get oacK on their tail.
- - WHAT? WH
  - Because they're coming right at us.
  - Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
- - You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
  - I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together."
    That's what I said.
- - '... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty
    of them-'
  - And determination.
- - That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
  - Wh... Where are we?
  - Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
- - What's going on?
  - I think we're going to exit the space port.
- - Excuse me?
  - They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
- - Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't
    know what it does either.
  - Why don't you just turn it on and see?
- - Where?
  - Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
- - Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
  - It's as far as it goes!
- - Could be this.
  - Push It. Hold it down.
- - Do your best, Tommy...
  - Oh god...
- - All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you
    keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
  - What kind of signal?
  - Anything.
  - Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
  - Tommy, we have these...
- - Oh, right, sorry.
  - Okay, let's go.
- - Sorry Guys... It just went off.
  - Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
- - Okay... On what?
  - How about the pig-lizard?
  - Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
- - Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
  - It doesn't have eyes.
  - The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
  - It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
- - NO NO NO.
  - We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
- - All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut
    it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex,
    see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't
    get the oxygen back in time.
  - Jason? What about me? What do I do?
  - Practice driving, Tommy.
- - Pedal to the metal Tommy...
  - Pedal to the metal...
- - Let's do it, Tommy.
  - Commander?... Call me Laredo?
  - Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
- - Hold course, Laredo!
  - I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that
    vox signal...
- - Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are
    Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come
    with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
  - Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with
    my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota
    the last time I did one of these
  - I... certainly, but-
  - Catch me later, okay?
- - Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you
    to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being
    systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris
    wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in
    this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please
    Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
  - Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
- - Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
  - Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
  - As you wish.
- - Commander?... Where are you... going?
  - Home.
  - You... You mean Earth?
  - Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
- - But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
  - Right. Long live... What's your planet?
  - Theramin.
  - Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
  - But what if Sarris survives?
  - Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
  - He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results
    of-
  - I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But
    listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
- - An interstellar vox.
  - Thanks
- - How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
  - It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
- - Weapons storage...
  - It's perfectly safe. I promise.
  - '... Maintenance facility...'
- - To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their
    heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
  - Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship,
    this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
- - Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
  - NO, Thank God he has not.
  - Then how did he find out about the device?
  - Our former Commander was not... Strong.
  - Former Commander?
  - I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
- - Commander...
  - Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
- - Mathesar? What is that?
  - It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
- - A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
  - You what?.. What are you talking about?
  - We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must
    lie with us, with the ship...
- - '"Deception..." "Lies."'
  - Well... Sort of...
  - We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris.
    Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver
    destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But
    if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
- - I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There
    is no snip.
  - But there it is!...
  - A model, only as big as this.
  - But... Inside, I have seen-
  - Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster.
    The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm
    not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
  - But...Why?
  - It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
- - The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't
    oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
  - You can oc that?
- - First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
  - Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full.
    Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And
    throw this thing at him too, killer.
- - Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
  - Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly
    as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
- - Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It
    was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable
    people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just
    awful about that.
  - Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
  - Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
  - You have ten seconds.
  - All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to
    set it up.
- - Yes.
  - Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
  - I don't know.
- - Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
  - Stop, please! I don't know!
  - Prepare a tear harness for the female...
  - No! I swear I don't know! Please!
  - Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld
    of his ship?
- - Wait. What did you say?
  - Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't
    know anything.
- - Explain -
  - Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
- - My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
  - Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater,
    no imagination these scientists.
  - We pretend...
  - Simpler.
  - We.. We lie.
  - Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
- - Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
  - This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
- - Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
  - This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
- - You're kidding. When for?
  - Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
- - Unbelievable.
  - You are so full of shit
- - You gotta admit, they do love him.
  - Almost as much as he loves himself.
- - That's it, It's go time.
  - Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
- - You should have let me hit him.
  - I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
- - You know, that's really getting annoying.
  - I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
  - Sure, no problem.
- - Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
  - I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
- - We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb,
    reset the pod, we're going back.
  - That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
  - Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
- - I heard it too.
  - Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
- - JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
  - Closer?  I can try.
  - "What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP\th37C"
- - Tommy, look!  Those lights...
  - "I see them!  I see them! RD STREET\tPASADENA 57"
- - A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most.
    It's a nothing.
  - How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
  - What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
- - What?
  - You smiled at me.
- - This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
  - You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your
    fans?...
- - It's Jason...
  - One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
  - Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
- - Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
  - Only answers to me.
  - But I'm the Commander!
  - On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they
    built.
  - C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
- - Wait. When are you going to tell them?
  - Tell them? About...
  - Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
  - Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
  - Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts...
    We can't do this stuff!
  - It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing
    is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
  - Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned
    a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
- - Hey... Hey where are you going?
  - We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
  - Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
- - We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
  - Let me think. I need time to think.
- - There's nobody here. Jason...
  - Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
- - All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's
    as stupid as he is ugly.
  - Jason..
  - We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
  - JASON...
  - You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
- - I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
  - I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the
    hold button is???
  - Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
- - Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
  - I don't think that's a cloud...
- - Are they behind us?
  - No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
- - Can it be repaired?
  - Computer, can it be repaired?
- - Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
  - Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
- - Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess
    and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
  - Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could
    have held on to me?
  - I could have held on to YOU! ...
- - You're playing your good side.
  - Don't be ridiculous.
- - 'All right... here''s the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those
    things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any
    of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.'
  - Why does this sound so familiar?
- - How does the rolling help, actually?
  - It helps.
- - Clenched jaw...
  - Will you stop RIDING ME?!
- - Jason.. Can you hear me?
  - Yes. Yes, I'm here!
- - Thank God. Are you okay?
  - Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
  - Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
- - What?  What did he say?
  - Nothing. Hold please.
- - Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
  - Turn on the translation circuit.
- - Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
  - What the hell are you talking about?
- - So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
  - Right.
  - Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron
    reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty
    sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
  - No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
- - There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
  - Wait... Jason, Here!...
- - What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY
    things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
  - Gwen...
  - We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
  - Because it was on the show!
  - Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
- - He's accelerating to Mark 6.
  - Mark 12.
- - never doubted you for a second.
  - TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
- - Hi everybody.
  - Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
  - 'Guy... You probably don''t remember me do you?   I was on the show in ''82.  Episode
    31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"'
- - More to the left... Stay parallel...
  - Hey, YOU want to drive?
- - '"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.'
  - We're doing episode 31?
  - Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
- - They're gone.
  - Where'd they go? Back inside?
- - You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
  - Not a clue. You?
  - I think he just likes pointing at things.
- - We're alive!
  - We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer,
    we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
- - ~e're alive!
  - We made it. Commander, we made it.'
- - '...Okay'
  - All right. Put me back on with him.
- - They're still behind us...
  - We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
- - Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
  - Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
  - Your last name.
  - Yeah, what is it?
  - It's... I don't know.
  - No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough
    for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come
    up with a last name for me?
- - We're screwed... We're so screwed...
  - All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going
    to have to exercise self control.
- - That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
  - Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
- - It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
  - Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
  - It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
  - BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
- - I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary
    lathe?...
  - A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
- - We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
  - No. Keep all energy to the armor.
- - Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's
    interested in an autograph? Never know.
  - Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
- - '"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.'
  - You... know us?
- - THAT'S why you built this ship?
  - It's ... incredible.
- - The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
  - The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical
    document.
- - Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
  - 'Do I? DO I?  For all you know I''m just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it''s FLEEGMAN!
    Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I''m a whole person! I can''t die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN''T
    KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?'
- - Where are the miners?
  - Something BAD happened here.
- - Oh, they're so cute.
  - Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY
    somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
- - I am SO SICK of being right.
  - Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
- - How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
  - We're doing episode 31, Jason?
- - How do you remember this stuff?
  - Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
- - You Okay, Alex?
  - I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
- - '...The digital conveyor.'
  - Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
- - We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
  - Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them
    back long enough for the aliens to escape.
  - It's suicide.
  - I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die,
    I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
  - Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
- - Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be
    able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic
    propulsion. What do you think?
  - I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
- - A hologram...
  - Never mind, Fred....
  - No, no... I'll think on it...
- - The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up
    there in a thousand pieces?
  - Right.
  - I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
- - No, I'll kill you. .
  - Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put
    your hands on the controls..
- - Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I
    swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines
    with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You
    can do this.
  - You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
- - As good as Hopkins?
  - Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
- - U.... What do you think?
  - That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
  - '... What does that mean?'
  - What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding
    molecules have become covalent?!...
  - Covalent... Right. So...
  - So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound
    sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
  - OK!
- - Structural damage at 68 percent.
  - We're getting major structural damage.
- - I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based
    on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait,
    wait, listen to this!  Computer?
  - Yes?
  - What's the weather like outside?
  - There is no weather in space.
  - I never get tired of that joke.
- - The ship is sustaining structural damage.
  - Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
- - The enemy is matching velocity.
  - The enemy is matching velocity.
- - Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
  - The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
  - It's fractured...
- - Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
  - We need another one.
- - Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
  - No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
- - Systems register functional.
  - All systems are working, Commander.
- - Systems register functional.
  - "All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc\tPINK) -' C -"
- - Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar
    Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
  - Excuse me guys.
- - Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary
    of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent
    of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
  - It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and
    wooden props, do you understand?
  - Yes but, we were wondering-
  - There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do
    you get it?
- - '... Yes?'
  - We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
  - Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
  - What's  your name, son?
  - Brandon.
  - Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little
    technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
  - Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you
    meant it constructively but...
  - It's okay. Listen-
  - '... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand
    completely that It''s just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium
    Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it''s all just a-'
  - It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
  - I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
  - Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
- - Okay, we got it.
  - Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system
    better than anybody alive.
- - Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there.
    Then go through the antimatter vent...
  - Okay...  Okay, now what.
  - Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing
    facility.  The bowels of the ship.
- - Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed
    on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show
    the whole thing.
  - We'd never have the budget for this.
  - Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to
    your left.
- - Yes...?
  - Okay, that's where you want to be.
- - Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
  - Yes Commander?
  - What does the Omega 13 do?
  - Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
  - What do you mean?
  - It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years.
    Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter
    in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
  - But you don't?
  - No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a
    matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen
    seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the
    past.
  - How did you come to that conclusion?
  - My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie
    is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
- - "BRANDON!\tTIME TO GO!"
  - Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers
    and over the pit.
- - Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time
    in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
  - Okay, now. But-
  - Wait two seconds then go.
- - No, wait, are you-
  - Lt. Madison, GO.
  - Shit! Go!
  - GO Commander.
- - Go. They're off again.
  - Up.
  - What?  Up?
  - Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
- - I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
  - Raise the glass and push the blue button.
  - That's It?
  - Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan
    onat.
- - He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
  - He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
- - Hi Brandon.
  - No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander
    needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
  - Oh.  Okay.
  - You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
  - I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
  - We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame
    rate is unacceptable.
- - He's a miserable twit!
  - The guy is terminally selfish!
- - Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
  - Dear God.... How did I come to this?
- - Alex you can't -just leave.
  - Oh can't I? Watch me!
- - Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
  - Why didn't you stop at the market?
  - I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
  - You could order something in.
  - A boy comes to the door.
  - I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
  - Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a
    roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
- - Oh my god, It's real.
  - All this from watching the.. historical records?
- - We heard it the first time!
  - Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
- - May I get the check?
  - The ships are gaining...
- - WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
  - FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
- - '"Go into the cloud! ...'
  - Alex? Where are you going?
  - To see if there's a pub.
- - Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
  - Could they be the miners?
- - I don't know.
  - Nobody was WATCHING?
- - Those blue things ate everybody here?
  - It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against
    those creatures...
- - He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
  - Down there.
- - You said "the Commander.
  - What?
  - Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
  - No I didn't.
  - Yes you did.
- - He always has to make the big entrance.
  - "By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159\tNT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT\t\
    159"
- - He's a twit!
  - Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
- - Not again...
  - I played Richard III...
- - Settle down, Alex...
  - No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time.
    I won't.  I can't!
- - What the hell is going on?!!?
  - Jason, what have you gotten us into?
- - He wants to THINK!?
  - No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
- - Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
  - They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
- - What's happened?
  - The engines are dead. We're drifting.
- - You were holding it upside down weren't you?
  - Shut up.
  - You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for
    a second.
  - You think you could do better "Laredo?"
  - Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
- - And note the sucked in gut.
  - '...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...'
- - This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that
    he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than
    THIS fellow.  No offense.
  - You have a better plan, Alex?
  - As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come
    sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for
    nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because
    we did it that way in episode 31.'
- - Come on, old friend...
  - Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
- - You WILL go out there.
  - I won't and nothing you say-
  - '"The show must go on."'
  - '...Damn you!  Damn you!'
- - I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer
    are loyalty...
  - '... to camera center no matter whose shot you''re blocking...'
  - Leadership....
- - God, what an ass.
  - COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
- - Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
  - '"Just!?"'
- - At ease men.
  - Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
- - We've got to stop!
  - We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
  - You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
  - Like YOU know?
- - NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
  - DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
  - KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
- - About this much.
  - What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
  - THIS much.
- - There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
  - Must be some sort of mining facility.
- - Go ahead!
  - You go first! There's no time!
  - Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid
    anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
- - What?  What?
  - Nothing.
  - I heard something. A squeal.
- - Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
  - KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
- - ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
  - '... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What''s its motivation?'
  - It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
  - That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock...
    I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's
    making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations
    stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes
    the vibrations..."
  - Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
- - Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered
    us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
  - Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
- - '"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"'
  - I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
  - Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
  - I had the shot...
- - ~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
  - Yes. Good was done this .....
  - Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
- - Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy
    surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
  - No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down...
    Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make
    sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
- - Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled
    to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though
    I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
  - Well good, that's very... nice.
  - By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
  - Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
  - I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
  - Just don't.
  - '...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.'
- - This is it?
  - Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
  - Where's my bed?
- - Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master
    the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
  - Is that the bathroom?
  - Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical
    records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
- - Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates
    of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
  - Thanks.
  - Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I
    wish you-
  - Uh uh! What did we talk about?
  - Right... Sorry, sir.
- - Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
  - Quellek. What are you doing in there?
  - I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
  - Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
- - Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
  - Open.
- - Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL
    BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood,
    horrified.
  - I'm... I'm shot.
- - Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
  - I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
  - No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
  - '... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example
    these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...'
- - Don't speak, Quellek.
  - You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met,
    always considered you as a father to me.
- - Are you looking for this?
  - Thanks.
- - Do I know you?
  - We've met before.
  - Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
- - SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip
    Raymond.
  - Sounds like a big company.
  - It's the French Secret Service.
  - Oh.
  - We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's
    nest.
  - Are you sure? How do you know?
  - We know.
  - Why are you telling this to me?
  - I need you to trust me.
  - Why do you need that?
  - I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
  - Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
  - We, have already taken care of them.
- - How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
  - This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
- - So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
  - I am not permitted to speak of such things.
- - I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
  - Sure.
  - It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself.
    From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
  - Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
  - Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean
    it up.
- - Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little
    luck, this will lead us right to it.
  - So you're in?
  - Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
- - What's with the chewing gum?
  - Makes us look more American.
- - They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
  - Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
- - Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
  - You were right.
- - I think we should leave now.
  - Good idea.
- - Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before
    these things escape.
  - How do I do that?
  - 555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
- - What'd they say?
  - I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
- - Who the hell are you?
  - It's okay. I know her.
- - Hello?
  - It's Raymond.
  - Where are you?
- - I understand.
  - I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
  - Wait.  Au revoir.
- - We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the
    buildings within the sequestered area.
  - But you don't know for sure!
- - General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more
    open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him
    down.
  - Last time you didn't even scratch it!
  - That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
- - Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the
    hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
  - We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
  - That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
- - Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway
    system.
  - You don't have the authority to do that.
- - Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
  - It's Tatopoulos.
  - Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
  - Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
  - Follow me.
- - You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered
    any of my questions.
  - We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
- - Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills
    are not my field.
  - We know.
- - Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
  - Yeah, you're the worm guy.
  - The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have
    any idea what that means?
  - No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
  - It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over
    seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
- - Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
  - They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've
    been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and
    study them.
  - Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
- - What sample?
  - You're standing on it.
- - That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
  - That's right.
  - But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
  - We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
- - Somebody must have seen it.
  - It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
- - The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique
    on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
  - Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
  - What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area
    that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
- - You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
  - What are you suggesting?
  - When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to
    chase them. I had to draw them out.
- - Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
  - You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't
    rely on heat seeking...
  - Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood
    I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already
    has.
- - No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens
    will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could
    be looking at an enormous population.
  - So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
  - It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
- - You gave them the tape?
  - No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
- - Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
  - They are with me!
- - CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
  - You're fast.
  - That is our job.
  - Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
  - Major, what do you think could have done this?
  - Get your people out of there or I will.
- - When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could
    be out of the quarantined zone.
  - Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
  - Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
  - Have them sealed off.
  - And how should we do that, Sir?
  - Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know,
    just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
- - Merde!
  - Allez, allez!
- - They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
  - That is when we will go in.
- - We've secured the doors on both levels.
  - Where's Luc and Pierre?
  - They didn't make it.
  - Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
- - Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
  - Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
- - Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
  - Oh, I'm not married.
  - Really? A girlfriend then?
  - No. Perhaps I work too much.
  - You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
- - Not for a long time, now.
  - Well, I think you're cute.
  - Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
- - Hence the radiation.
  - More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall
    out in that region.
- - Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done
    before?
  - I don't think so.
- - I'm sorry about all this.
  - Me too.
- - Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
  - I'll try.
- - Did you talk with Humphries?
  - This is not the place...
  - Just tell me, did you talk with him?
  - He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
  - Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
- - Mr. Caiman, you're married.
  - And you're beautiful...
  - Mr. Caiman...
  - Call me Charlie.
  - Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for
    nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important
    to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going
    someplace.
  - So have dinner with me tonight.
  - I can't.
  - It's your choice.
- - Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
  - What?
  - I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
  - Not now. You got my bag?
- - You don't understand, I can get us information...
  - Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
- - We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
  - We? I don't think so.
  - I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
  - Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
- - Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
  - What's it to you?
  - Can I use some?
  - What do I get?
  - The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
  - Five bucks.
  - You're kidding, right?
- - And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
  - Speak of the devil.
- - My life sucks.
  - Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
- - I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
  - He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
- - It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
  - Who is he?
  - He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the
    hell is he doing in Panama.
- - Did Romeo have a name?
  - Nick Tatopoulos.
- - Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
  - That's the problem. He did.
- - What the hell are you doing?
  - Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
  - Your old sweetheart?
  - Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow
    all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know
    it. You got any tape or glue?
  - I left my forgery kit back at the office.
- - Wish me luck!
  - Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have
    your job.
  - I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's
    a story here I'm going to find it.
- - I'll take them all.
  - You must have quite some harem.
- - Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
  - It's good to see you, Nick.
- - So you made it.
  - What?
- - You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you.
    Really, I am.
  - Yeah, well...
- - So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
  - No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring"
    creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
  - You're still mad at me, aren't you?
  - You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah,
    I guess I'm still a little mad.
  - That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
  - Most people don't.
  - I'm sorry you feel that way.
- - Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup
    of tea?
  - Sure. I'd like that.
- - I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working
    for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
  - When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness.
    But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
  - And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
  - I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result
    of what we've done to nature.
  - And you think this creature is one of them?
  - Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
  - Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
  - I got pretty close.
  - What else do you know about it?
- - '...he''s pregnant.'
  - Are you sure?
- - Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're
    looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
  - I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
- - The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it,
    all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction.
    That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors,
    he's nesting!
  - Nesting?
  - Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs
    at a time!
- - Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
  - Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
  - You never said it was off the record.
  - I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
  - I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.
    When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't.
    That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
  - So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
- - What are you doing here?
  - I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
  - I was wrong.
- - Circuits are overloaded.
  - I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
- - Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
  - How do you know?
  - Our network covers the Ranger games.
- - The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
  - Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
- - If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before
    they can escape.
  - Oh my God! They're coming!
- - Are you okay?
  - Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
  - You'd be surprised.
  - Really? I'd like to find out.
- - Who was that French guy, anyway.
  - Oh, just some insurance guy.
- - I like that image.
  - You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
- - Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
  - Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
  - Well, I can be tough if I want.
- - That why you dumped him?
  - No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer
    picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
- - How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
  - Nearly four years...
- - Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
  - Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
- - He stole my report! That's my report!
  - We know, Audrey.
- - You okay?
  - It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This
    isn't me. I don't do things like this.
  - You made a mistake.
- - Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
  - Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
  - Yeah. Why are you asking?
  - I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
- - My God. He's going after the nest.
  - Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
- - Animal, I can't.
  - Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your
    chance.
- - What are you doing?
  - Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
- - What are you doing?
  - It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired
    it last year I worked on a piece about it.
- - Don't you think we have enough?
  - Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
- - Think we can fit up in there?
  - Only one way to find out.
- - He's not going to do it.
  - Oh yes he will.
- - Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
  - You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
  - The JFK? In the rain!?
- - What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
  - But we can get to the west side faster.
- - Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
  - No.
- - That's cuz I'm married to you.
  - Shut up. How can you eat like that?
  - Big bites.
- - I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
  - Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
  - Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in
    this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry,
    baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
- - Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
  - Great. See ya then.
- - Who the hell are all these people?
  - What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
  - Where's Audrey?
  - In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
  - What?
  - All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
  - Me!? You where the one...
  - Go in there. Talk to her.
- - Subject?
  - O'Neil, Jordan.
  - Thought you two were file-closed.
  - You knew about us?
  - Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
- - All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
  - The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst
    possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
  - Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the
    sights.
  - The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs
    to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's
    co-ed?
  - Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to
    start his watch with such a public failure?
  - Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
  - Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
- - The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been
    said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
  - The first female President?
  - Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven
    a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
  - Women.
  - If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
  - I don't know.  Seems...
  - This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The
    implications go way beyond.
  - Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
  - I take it this file is still open.
  - Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know
    what I mean?
  - Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things
    might be handled there.
  - I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
  - This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to
    control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes
    everything very controllable.
- - We're fucked.
  - Darth Vader reads poetry...
  - We are so fucked.
- - Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
  - Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
- - You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
  - So am I.
- - This ain't workin' right!
  - What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
  - This ain't even workin' wrong!
- - Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
  - Your new roommate.
- - Anybody usin' these drawers here?
  - Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right
    next to me.
  - Funny, the C.O. says I can.
- - Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got
    nothin' but rooms over there.
  - That your desk?  I'll take this one.
  - WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
  - Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or
    classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
- - Clear.
  - North?
- - All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio
    -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
  - Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
  - MOVE!
- - I just wonder how that happened.
  - Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try
    a wrench on that thing.
- - You don't suppose this is just part of...
  - FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell
    you waiting for?
- - Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
  - Shut your hole, Slutnik.
- - Say again, sir?
  - You heard me.  Move on.
- - Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
  - Educate her, Pyro.
- - Permission to get dressed, sir?
  - It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their
    viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females
    -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They
    don't use women anymore.
  - Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it
    for?
  - For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
  - I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries
    to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
  - Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
- - Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women
    around.  And that is an historical fact.
  - It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should
    be sniffing around their shower room instead.
- - England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
  - McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
  - You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There
    are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
- - Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's
    name?
  - '"Dad."'
  - Any brothers?  Sisters?
  - Dick, Jane, and Spot.
  - Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
  - Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put
    me in the cage.
  - You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
  - Should I be afraid?
  - Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My
    world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere
    else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can
    do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
- - Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
  - Wasn't deemed a threat.
  - She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
- - Would you have shot if it was a man?
  - No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
  - The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let
    them.  Because you went soft on another women --
  - That's not right.
  - That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
  - I think you're the liar.
  - I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars,
    you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
  - We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
  - You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
- - Do you?
  - No.
  - I'm so glad we agree.
- - Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about
    that?
  - Sure.  Just like your men do.
  - I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
- - Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some
    new alloy of all three.
  - Good to see you again, too, sir.
  - Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
- - Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll
    fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked
    by a reef.  Over.
  - Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
  - Say again?  How many micks?
  - 15, sir.
- - Got it.
  - Show us where you are, Chief.
- - O'Neil...
  - Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
- - What're you guys doing?  Huh?
  - Just askin'
  - What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's
    exactly what they --
- - She part of the training?
  - I don't know...
- - If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now
    how smart is that?
  - Mighta been civilian.
- - 32 feet, six inches!
  - I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
- - '''Cool?'
  - Smoke it!
- - So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
  - Maybe half.  Not even.
  - Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help
    him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
- - They're more afraid of you.
  - Well, now I feel so much better.
  - It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say
    anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
  - Whose orders were those?
  - It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until
    S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
  - And how do you know that?
  - Made it to Week 10 last time.
  - I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
  - You're kind of a surprise yourself.
- - Hey.  Way to gut it out.
  - Thanks, Wick.
- - Who is it?
  - You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
  - Wick.  They got your crew, too?
  - Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
- - You really came back for more?  Of this?
  - When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame
    it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
  - If you got a good one, Wick...
- - One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right
    before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil,
    maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the
    hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to
    the nuts.
  - They had to kill 'em?
  - Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro
    cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come
    back any time they wanted.
  - That's a good story.
  - So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it
    was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
  - He was married?
  - At first.
  - You got anybody, Wick?
  - Not me.  You?
- - O'Neil?
  - How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
  - Last time I didn't.
  - Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
- - Sorry, didn't mean to --
  - That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
  - First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
  - Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't
    wanna come, do you?
  - I can't go out.  Not like this.
  - I think you look beautiful.
  - Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird
    if we hook up.  Besides...
- - Do you, uh, know...
  - Sure, sure.
  - We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing
    special.
  - Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
- - I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
  - This is insane.  You've got no proof.
- - Lieutenant O'Neil.
  - Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
  - Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
- - Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
  - Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it
    is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
  - Chances of recovery?
  - You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
- - North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The
    civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction
    team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem
    is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's
    The Polk?
  - Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just
    not out.
  - Unless you Whiskey Run.
  - Blank faces here, O'Neil.
  - 'Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards
    and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files
    -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks
    up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don''t waste time opening and
    closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.'
- - You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
  - Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
- - That was good headwork, lieutenant.
  - Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
  - Probably hear back from CNN first.
  - Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
  - Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
- - By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it
    with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
  - Is this my glory, sir?
- - So why're you even considering it? Are you?
  - Just like you would be.
  - Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you
    there, Jordan.
  - I take it you don't either.  Feet.
- - Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
  - Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting
    in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you
    about the Navy?
  - She's haze grey and underway...
  - You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go
    operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped
    out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
  - So dump on me.
  - This has nothing to do with you.
  - Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
  - Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
  - You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
  - Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado...
    what happens here?
  - I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
  - Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of
    operational duty. What then?
  - I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe
    we should just let it happen.
  - Which is guy-speak for...
  - Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest,
    okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then,
    Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
  - You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
- - Jordan...
  - Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go
    and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
- - I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
  - It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
  - How hard they making it on you?
- - That bad?
  - I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey,
    what'd I expect?
- - Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh
    stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking
    steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
  - Me?  Why me?
  - Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
  - I saw an article...
  - I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're
    all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing
    you up for that poster.
- - So why are you telling me this?
  - Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
  - You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
  - I'm only trying to warn you in case --
  - 'Well, let me warm you:  I''m going though with this.  The more everybody fucks
    with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don''t
    expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?'
  - That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
  - Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
  - Jordan.  You watch your ass.
  - Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
- - All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
  - And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking
    back for...
  - Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost
    like...  Did I say he was class officer?
  - Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
  - No shortage of suspects.
  - The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
- - C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
  - It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
  - Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your
    head, and you're not gonna fight back?
  - I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you
    here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
  - Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
- - '"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.'
  - What about him.
  - Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one
    year -- your year.  That sound right?
  - Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
  - Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
  - I don't know, I don't care.
  - Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer
    like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
- - '"In Washington..."'
  - What?
  - Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
- - '"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him
    stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.'
  - You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from
    someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
  - I'd sure like to know who.
  - Yeah.  Me too.
- - So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
  - Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call
    in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are
    ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
  - Which is guy-speak for...
  - '"Yes, Jordan -- I''ll wait for you no matter how long."'
- - Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
  - Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
  - I'll try anyway, sir.
  - You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
- - Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming,"
    O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where
    you been the last few years?
  - What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
- - The Navy Cross...
  - I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you
    to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
  - I was looking for him earlier, but...
  - The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred
    he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
  - Just a coincidence?
  - Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the
    Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
- - Time.
  - Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
- - Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to
    lose him.
  - Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
- - Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire
    is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
  - Get it up!
- - You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat
    of rape would be used to leverage the men?
  - You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
  - I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna
    be one.
  - She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
  - She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
  - She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
  - Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not
    some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine,
    maybe yours.
  - I oughtta report you.
  - I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
- - Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
  - I can make this wall without --
  - '... two... one... MARK!'
- - Just do it, okay?
  - If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts
    to butts!
  - Come on, Montgomery...
  - Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
- - O'Neil?
  - Sir?
  - You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
- - Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
  - It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For
    short, ma'am.
  - So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
  - No, ma'am.
  - Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it
    and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us
    both, okay?
  - I'll work on it, ma'am.
  - Do that.
- - Hey.  You okay, Flea?
  - '''Snot me.  It''s him.'
- - Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
  - Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction.
    Stand by for a PRC fix...
- - Close as I can get, el-tee!
  - Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
- - Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
  - Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with
    a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
- - So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
  - I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent
    drop-out rate among the men.
  - Then I suggest we start there.
  - Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando
    training course.  And I don't care who it is.
- - What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
  - I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's
    apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
  - '"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn''t last a week? Huh?'
- - So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
  - Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
  - High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks
    in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state
    of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
- - '"Coronado."'
  - California.
  - I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but...
    do you understand that this involves combat training?
  - This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it
    could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually,
    its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
  - Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
  - My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at
    the proper time.  Jumping off now...
  - Uh, question, ma'am.
  - Yes, dear.
  - Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
  - There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very
    large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
- - Can't complain, ma'am.
  - Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
  - Uh, ma'am.
  - Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were
    a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego,
    so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
- - Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for
    a child-care vote that --
  - Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
- - You know him.
  - Sounds familiar.
  - It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated
    me.
  - Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but
    now is scarcely --
  - Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
  - Absolutely not.
- - Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were
    getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
  - What changed?
  - Should probably ask him that.
  - If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
- - So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
  - What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know --
    that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
  - You don't know that.
  - 'In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.'
  - What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That
    a women's death hurts a family more?
  - I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this
    into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will
    fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war --
    and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
- - You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or
    thought you did.
  - Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's
    more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
  - So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
  - 'The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don''t need to
    compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing
    in some third-world jungle with --'
  - I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's
    how it should've been.
- - I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on
    that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
  - You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
  - I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's
    quite verifiable.
  - I'm sure it is.
  - You'll think about my offer?
  - You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
  - Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was
    off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics
    with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
- - '... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval
    service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What''s more, the
    Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --'
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize
    that...
- - Hardly the case, Senator.
  - Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump
    right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over
    the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case
    in point...
- - '"The Lark Report."'
  - Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously
    question whether --
  - The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female
    aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion,
    am I right?
  - I was one member of the investigating commission.
  - Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And
    your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
  - I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
  - I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything,
    Mr. Hayes.
- - The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper
    approach to the carrier.
  - That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report...
    the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated
    situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my
    seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm
    deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women
    in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
- - White House boys want a private meeting.
  - I'll act surprised.
- - Think I overplayed it?
  - Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak
    it is.
- - Yes?
  - Did you hear?
  - She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
  - Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that
    would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion
    Laws.
- - Shit.  Think we're had.
  - Smoke her.
  - I ain't gonna shoot her.
  - Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
  - Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
- - Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
  - Fuck me.
- - What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
  - O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that,
    don't you?
- - Aw, what is this...
  - Sir...
- - Ah, c'mon...
  - Motherachrist...
- - Fine by me, sir!
  - No problem, sir!
- - Newberry, get a photo.  South?
  - Entering my scan now...
  - West?
- - Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
  - Thank you, sir.
  - Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
  - I'm fine, sir.
  - So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating
    the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make
    it as painless as possible for you.
  - Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
- - Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
  - Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all
    I'm going to ask.
  - Really, I have no problem with --
  - I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate
    heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate
    or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform
    me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
  - None at this time, sir.
  - Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
- - Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want
    to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting
    operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
  - If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements
    about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
- - Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I
    was being mistreated in any way.
  - Didn't take long.
- - All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an
    action first thing in the morning.  A name?
  - It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
  - Oh, really.
  - It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's
    how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
  - Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
  - I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when
    you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still
    lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I
    mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around
    the base?
  - Did you just have a brain-fart?
  - Pardon?
  - Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard
    that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
  - I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
- - What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for
    her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is
    now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's
    lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can
    keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent
    your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty-
    nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic
    nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
  - No, sir.
  - No, sir, WHAT?
  - The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
- - Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that
    what you're after?
  - Same rules for everyone, sir.
  - Straight up?
  - Across the board, sir.
  - And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin'
    to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any
    one in particular.
  - Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
- - Then good night.
  - So I'll get a fair shot?
  - You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna
    get.
- - See me, sir?
  - You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
- - Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article,
    not --
  - '"We''ll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let''s be sure to invite this sociologist,
    too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!'
- - Permission to leave, sir?
  - Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
- - I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims
    have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically,
    that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at
    such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
  - Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
- - I'm saying, we're just friends.
  - I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on
    my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will
    definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
  - Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through
    the mud...
  - I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
- - Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go
    forward?
  - I'm not sure what --
  - Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
- - Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ,
    nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
  - Sir?  What did he say?
  - Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
- - Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base
    snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
  - Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
  - -- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin'
    what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
  - -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil
    liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
  - Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I
    mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
- - Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point
    forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned
    if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this
    one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin'
    dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
  - Your prerogative, Senator.
  - Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
  - Standing right here in my office.
  - Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
- - Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
  - '"Security"?  What the hell you talkin'' about?  Your base isn''t secure?'
  - Of course, but there's more --
  - Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up
    with details.  Jumping off, now...
- - B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
  - Thank you, ensign.
  - No problem, lieutenant.
- - They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come
    back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
  - That's what I hear.
  - Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're
    kinda curious.
  - Who's "we"?
  - Just some of the women.
- - I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had
    this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's
    uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe
    10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And
    I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee,
    I wish I were a man."
  - I've been accused of that wish.
  - The woman I saw you with...
  - Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
  - But are there... I mean, how many...
  - More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more
    then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of
    uprising.
- - Administration, Ensign Blondell.
  - Don't say my name.
  - Who's...  Lieuten --
  - Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
  - Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
  - '"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.'
- - Got it.
  - Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
  - Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See
    Addendum."  Checking...
- - Wow...
  - What'd you find, Kathy?
- - How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican
    border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along
    fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
  - Okay, I'll have one.
- - In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
  - Yeah, it's mine.
  - Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
- - You could take their head off.
  - Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's
    a preacher.
- - He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and
    filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only
    thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
  - He needs our help!
  - He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You
    can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again.
    We're sticking together.
- - What the fuck was that about?
  - He signaled the Ranger.
- - What the fuck is wrong with you --
  - 'Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by
    the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:'
- - Start the car.
  - You believe me don't cha?
  - Shut up and start the car.
- - Richie? You okay?
  - I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
- - Yeah?
  - When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
  - Gotcha!
  - One... Two... Three.
- - What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
  - What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
  - He didn't recognize shit.
- - Do they have cable?
  - No.
  - Do they have an X-rated channel?
  - No.
  - Do they have a waterbed?
  - They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
- - How's it feel?
  - How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
- - I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping
    assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
  - Feels good.
  - I'm gonna go get the money.
- - Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
  - That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
  - Did you even to try to negotiate?
  - These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know
    the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty
    percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You
    want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
  - All I'm saying --
  - -- This conversation is over.
- - Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
  - Sight seein'.
  - What'd ya see?
  - Cops.
  - Didya look at the border?
- - Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's
    about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
  - They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
- - I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around
    El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
  - Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
  - Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better.
    We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna
    stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us.
    Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The
    El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
  - How do you know?
  - I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is
    gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos
    and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
- - Where's the woman?
  - What?
- - What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
  - She's in the other room.
  - What the fuck is she doin' there?!
- - Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
  - There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what
    I had to do.
  - No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
  - Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole
    different person.
  - Is it me? Is it my fault?
  - It's not your fault, it's her fault!
- - Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
  - What?
  - This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop
    me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women.
    What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
  - Seth, if you were me --
  - Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
  - Yes.
  - Yes, Seth, I understand.
  - Yes, Seth, I understand.
- - Richard!
  - What?
- - This isn't gonna work.
  - Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
  - I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
  - Duly noted. Now, shut up.
- - They're gonna search the van.
  - As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
  - What does that mean?
  - What?
- - You just called me a fuckin' nut.
  - No, I didn't.
  - Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that
    I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
  - Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
  - You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
- - This ain't the time, Richard.
  - Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that
    stops the train on its tracks.
  - Keep your voice down.
  - Or what?
- - I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
  - This ain't the time.
  - Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out?
    Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But
    you know what? I can fix that right now.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah, I think so. What happened?
  - I don't know, you just passed out.
  - I did?
  - Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting,
    then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
  - Really?
  - Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta
    me. Sure you're okay?
  - Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
  - Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially
    Mexicans.
  - What?
  - We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
  - We are?
  - Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze
    till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick
    fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
- - Far out.  Where are my glasses?
  - They broke when you fell.
  - Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
  - Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
  - What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't
    fuckin' see.
  - When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
  - Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
  - It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie,
    stop bringing me down with bullshit.
- - That's what you think?
  - That's how you're lookin', Richie.
  - I'm lookin' scared?
  - That's what you look like.
  - You know what you look like?
  - No, Richie, what do I look like?
  - You're lookin' green.
- - How?
  - Where are you right now?
  - What do you mean?
  - Where are you?
  - I'm here with you.
  - No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray.
    We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about
    getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock.
    That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood,
    we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
  - My shit is together.
  - It don't look together.
  - Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just
    not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since
    I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
- - Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
  - Yeah.
  - Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
  - Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
- - How are you?
  - Scarred for life, that's how I am!
- - Whiskey!
  - You can't come in here.
  - What dya mean?
  - This is a private club. You're not welcome.
  - Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
  - This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
- - Best in Mexico.
  - I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
- - What do you want from me? I did what you said.
  - Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
  - He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times.
    If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
  - I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you
    can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
- - Were you giving that pig signals?
  - What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
- - He says you were scratching.
  - I wasn't scratching!
  - You callin' him a liar?
- - I never said help us!
  - Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live!
    Richie!
- - Hot goddamn day!
  - Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
  - Not even for lunch?
  - I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
- - Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those
    burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack
    Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
  - Whatsamatter?
  - Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First
    off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers
    was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies.
    I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten
    thirty.
  - Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
  - Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's
    mind?
  - You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent,
    not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
  - What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of
    a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit
    happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
  - That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
  - Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller
    as a hostage.
- - They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And
    if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get
    'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
  - Knock yourself out.
- - Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in
    front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
  - Six-fifty.
- - For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the
    next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers
    have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
  - Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
  - Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend
    to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
  - Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria
    Hill?
  - We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
  - What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the
    brothers was shot?
  - This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have
    reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the
    vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
  - Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life
    of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force
    are taking this manhunt personally?
  - I would say that's a very safe assumption.
- - Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
  - -- you got your microwave --
  - -- you got your sink --
  - -- you got your shower --
  - -- see this, television!
  - Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
- - Creepy guy.
  - 'The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth''s head. He''s just solved a
    problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how
    he''s going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back
    into room #9.'
- - You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do
    you understand what I just said?
  - Yes.
  - Do you believe me?
  - Yes.
  - You damn well better. Go.
- - Yeah.
  - You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
  - Yeah, we got a bible.
  - Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
- - You're gonna let us go?
  - In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now,
    I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but
    from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up,
    and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says,
    "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a
    few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
    can't miss it.
- - How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
  - Okay.
- - Are you okay?
  - Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I
    just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire,
    even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business,
    everything's hunky-dory.
  - I'm really sorry.
  - Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
- - We have to go back for Daddy!
  - Daddy's dead.
  - Noooo!
- - Watch my back!
  - Anytime.
- - How many bullets left, kid?
  - Not many.
  - Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing
    for their supper.
- - Should I use the last bullets on us?
  - You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
- - I'm sorry.
  - Me too.
- - See ya.
  - Later.
- - What's going on?
  - We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
- - Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
  - Sure.
- - What?
  - Where are you taking us?
  - Mexico.
  - What's in Mexico?
  - Mexicans.
- - What?
  - In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing
    it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
  - Do what?
  - What you said to me in the room.
  - What did I say?
  - You asked me if I would --
- - It's the bitterest of pills.
  - You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor
    on me.
  - Ain't it the truth.
- - I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's
    sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're
    not like a real bed.
  - Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
- - Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel
    Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back.
    He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
  - That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother
    waiting.
  - I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But
    you don't believe in God anymore?
  - Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's
    death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer.
    My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me
    anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus.
    But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
  - It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached
    trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
  - I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
  - That happens, you'll get it back.
  - Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service
    of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a
    preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during
    your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I
    a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced
    is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided
    not to devote my life to God anymore.
  - What do you think Mom would say?
  - Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
- - There's nothing wrong with this place.
  - It's a flop house.
  - It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
  - If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
- - It has a bed. That's all I care about.
  - Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
- - About two hours from now.
  - So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right
    out the front door.
- - You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
  - No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
- - I promise.
  - Scott?
- - Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three...
    four...
  - Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
  - Not good enough, swear to God.
  - I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will
    kill you.
  - Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count
    of three. One...
- - I'm going for 'em!
  - No!
  - Everybody goes home!
- - What's your name?
  - Jacob.
  - Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll
    shoot you in the face.
- - What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
  - He's my son.
  - How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
  - Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
  - Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
  - What's this about, money?
  - It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are
    in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
- - It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
  - Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says
    sit the fuck down!
- - Where are the keys to the motor home?
  - On the dresser.
  - Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
- - Not a chance.
  - Come again?
  - If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
  - Sorry, I need everybody.
  - My children are not going with you, and that's that.
  - That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
- - Yes.
  - Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
- - Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course
    it is.  What are their names?
  - Scott and Kate.
- - Who's this?
  - My wife.
  - Where is the little lady?
  - In heaven.
  - She's dead?
  - Yes, she is.
  - How'd she die?
  - Auto wreck.
  - Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
  - No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop
    suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
  - Died instantly?
  - Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed
    on.
  - Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
  - Yes, they do.
- - Is this real?
  - Yes.
  - I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister
    of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you
    the real McCoy?
  - Real McCoy.
  - You're a preacher?
  - I was a minister.
  - Was? As in not anymore?
  - Yes.
  - Why'd ya quit?
  - I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get.
    Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I
    won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your
    own business.
  - I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly.
    But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two
    ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin'
    night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go
    down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second,
    we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family.
    Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things
    I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right
    now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but
    I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice,
    or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety
    of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
  - Yes.
  - I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us
    the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll
    let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your
    kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
  - How do I know you'll keep your word?
  - Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
  - You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation
    makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince
    me you're telling the truth.
  - Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck
    in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry
    about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my
    brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked
    at her, didn't ya?
  - Yes.
  - Didn't like it, did ya?
  - No, I didn't.
  - Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave,
    get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter
    and let you all loose in the morning.
  - You won't let him touch her?
  - I can handle Richie, don't worry.
- - If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have,
    nothing will stop me from killing him.
  - Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
- - Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the
    border.
  - I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
  - You best better get it done, Pops.
- - I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
  - As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
  - I don't have the slightest idea.
  - Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
- - We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us
    go.
  - Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
- - Then?
  - Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
- - Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
  - Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
- - Who else?
  - Pass.
  - Why not, against your religion?
  - No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
  - Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
- - Why are you so agitated?
  - I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender
    sticks a weed up my ass, too.
  - He backed down.
  - He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear
    that loud and clear.
  - What are you going to do?
  - I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop,
    if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break
    it over his melon head.
  - Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
  - I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
  - Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
- - What did you call me?
  - Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask
    it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The
    entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you?
    No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way
    you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
- - To your family.
  - To yours.
- - Now, is your shit together?
  - Forever together.
- - Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
  - Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying
    to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't
    wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin'
    believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with
    my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with
    vampires.
- - You too, preacher?
  - I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
  - Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we
    know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
  - In the Winnebago.
  - In other words, no.
- - I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta
    be an official crucifix.
  - What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official?
    If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross
    represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
  - Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
- - Did he...?
  - Yep.
- - You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless
    pieces of shit!
  - You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got
    much time.
- - What's this stuff?
  - My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers
    and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole
    off the trucks.
  - Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through
    that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
  - I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many
    of these devils back to hell as I can.
  - Amen.
- - I promise.
  - Kate, Scott?
- - We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which
    is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
  - Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
- - Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what
    say we drop this?
  - The truth hurts.
- - Why do you want to stop?
  - I'm exhausted.
  - Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
- - What's this guy's problem?
  - I have no idea.
- - What are you gonna do?
  - I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
  - No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
- - Have you forgotten about your sister?
  - They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out
    in the desert and shoot us.
  - If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
  - Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell
    you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
  - What about Kate?
  - They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting
    chance.
  - Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're
    going to have to trust me on this.
  - If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you
    don't tell the cops, I will.
- - Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me!
    Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
  - He's running the show.
  - I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking
    with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing
    to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass.
- - You don't believe in suicide.
  - It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
  - Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
  - Thank you, son.
- - Why did they block the door again?
  - To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
- - Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
  - Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us
    rendezvous at that place?
  - I don't know, one place's as good as another.
  - Have you ever been there before?
  - No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It
    seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open
    from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
  - Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this
    girl's family's dead.
- - I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
  - Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode
    when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
- - Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
  - You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good
    start.
  - Twenty-eight.
  - Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all
    your fault. Twenty.
- - You like the car?
  - I said new, this is an '90.
  - It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
    times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
  - So do I just follow you?
  - Yeah, follow us.
  - So let's do it.
  - Vamanos!
- - How many with you?
  - Just my son and I.
  - What is your purpose in Mexico?
  - Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
- - What was that?
  - Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
  - You said it was just you and your son.
  - I meant me, my son and my daughter.
  - Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
- - I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
  - I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get
    one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
  - Why not?
- - Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We
    get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything
    when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
  - You've made a science out of coincidence.
- - Have to drop you here, Steve.
  - Sure.
- - Good luck.
  - Another coincidence.
  - Yeah.
- - Anything else you want?
  - No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
  - You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
  - I got to.
  - Aw.
- - I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense
    of the word.
  - They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
  - How much do I owe you?
  - One night on the town.
  - I mean...
  - '...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make
    up for me spending the night alone.'
- - Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
  - That's thirty percent.
  - For two lonely nights.
- - Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
  - There you are dead wrong.
- - It's beautiful...
  - Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
- - Cowboy.
  - Girls can't be cowboys.
  - Okay, Fireman.
- - Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
  - Rocky Road.
- - Last line of Gone With the Wind?
  - Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
- - You okay?
  - Those things can be nasty.
- - Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
  - But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just
    saw it.
- - How about our last jay?
  - Good call.
- - Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
  - Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a
    minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
- - Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
  - Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
  - I love you.
  - I love you.
- - What about Neddy?
  - I don't love Neddy.
  - He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
  - Ned!
  - Don't call him.
  - I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do
    whatever he wants to do, you know.
  - I guess...
- - Looks like a storm.
  - I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
  - You? The brick?
- - It's just a dream.
  - I call it my shower dream.
- - This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
  - Lead the way!
- - Are you wet?
  - Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
- - Mmmmmmmph?
  - Mmmmmmmph.
  - Best over...
  - Umhummmmph.
  - Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
  - Whassamatta?
  - Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
- - Ha!
  - Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
- - Ow!
  - I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp
    Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
- - What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
  - 'Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana
    or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.'
- - Jack?
  - Coach, athletic director somewhere.
- - It's gonna be a long summer.
  - Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter
    which a camper never sent home. Listen.
- - Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed
    to be real shitty.
  - God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
- - Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
  - I don't believe you...
  - Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
- - You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
  - God, but I love that sexy talk.
- - What do you want to be when you grow up?
  - Dancer.
- - Holy shit...
  - We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
- - No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing
    that? What's to eat?
  - Whatever you make yourself.
- - What hath God wrought?
  - That was the telephone.
  - Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What
    hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
- - What the hell?
  - Where'd you get that stuff?
- - Give me a hand?
  - For sure.
- - This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
  - Here we go.
- - I'll be okay. Holy shit...
  - Don't get up. Take a second...
- - You saved my life.
  - I had to.
  - Thanks.
  - I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would
    have ruined my appetite.
- - Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
  - A short somewhere.
- - What is it?
  - Is it stuck?
- - Roll him over!
  - Get behind him more.
- - Chance to get even?
  - I'll spot you five points.
- - You just had some lucky shots.
  - Where's Ned?
- - You said we were special.
  - I meant everything.
- - You know what I said, though.
  - I can't, Barry...
- - I wouldn't know.
  - Oh, you...
- - Claudette...
  - Somebody'll see.
  - No, they won't...
- - Somebody's there, Barry.
  - Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
  - Let's go back, Barry...
  - I need you so much, Claudette.
- - How come?
  - Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
- - I'll be along.
  - Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
- - I'm sorry.
  - Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all
    the entertainment, okay?
- - Sure.
  - I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
  - You're welcome.
- - Steve said for you to start on the boats.
  - I finished the boats.
- - Alice? The others show up?
  - Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
- - You think you're gonna last all summer?
  - I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
- - Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
  - Un-hunh.
- - Oh, my God...
  - You okay?
- - How come you're leaving?
  - It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
  - Maybe I can help?
- - And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
  - You're right. It makes no sense.
- - Filmmaker.
  - Artist.
- - It still hurts?
  - I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I
    just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When
    I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
- - What'll you do when you leave here?
  - I don't know.
- - I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
  - Almost five.
- - You can only do what you can do.
  - And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about
    children...
- - How the... did he get in there?
  - Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
- - Trouble?
  - Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
- - Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
  - Not if they're where I think they are.
- - It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't
    look so great if he fell over them.
  - Good point.
  - Well, it hasn't been that long.
- - Help you clean up?
  - Absolutely.
- - I don't hear it anymore.
  - Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
  - It sounded like Brenda.
  - I'll go take a look.
  - Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
- - Where?
  - They're off now.
- - I'll go check on Brenda.
  - Okay.
- - Jack?
  - Marcie?
  - Hey, guys!
- - It's dead. Try the pay phone.
  - Do you have a dime? A quarter?
  - No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
- - What's the matter with it?
  - Wet. I don't know.
- - Why don't we run? Just run now?
  - It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things
    will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
- - Cabin B is ready.
  - Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
- - That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got
    some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse.
    I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
  - You told her to sweep the courts.
- - You draw very well.
  - Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
- - Any particular reason?
  - Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
  - You want to leave?
  - I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
  - You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
    life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready.
    Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
- - Next Friday.
  - Thanks, Alice.
- - I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll
    be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
  - Sure.
- - What'd you see?
  - I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
- - Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
  - Tomorrow is another day.
  - Right! Right!
- - Melvin Belli.
  - I was careless.
- - I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
  - Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
  - I guess...
- - Good night, Alice.
  - Good night, Brenda.
- - He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
    my God, oh my God... oh God...
  - It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
  - Jack? Marcie? Ned?
- - It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
  - No, no, they're all dead...
- - So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
  - Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
- - The killer is still out there.
  - I will protect you.
- - We should go now.
  - Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
- - You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
  - I'm... dying.
- - Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
  - Are you a physician?
  - How is it you come to be here?
  - There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed
    from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
  - Ah. An explorer.
  - Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
  - I heard.
  - I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort
    of... creature.
  - Creature? A... human like creature?
  - You know of it?
  - Your men are right to be afraid.
  - Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning
    this. My entire fortune.
  - You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
  - Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind...
    those live on.
- - Do you share my madness?
  - Madness?
- - We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost
    in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious
    and evil in man.
  - Who are you?
  - My name is Frankenstein...
- - Professor Waldman.
  - Victor, explain yourself.
  - Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
  - You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with
    your studies.
  - To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled
    at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the
    new.
  - You disdain accepted wisdom?
  - No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries
    of what is known.
- - Preposterous.
  - I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure
    was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever
    since.
- - Electricity.
  - It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should
    be learning this!
  - Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more
    than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
  - But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this
    could change our fundamental views!
  - It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be
    wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience.
    We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own
    business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do
    so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal
    studies.
  - I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
  - Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
- - '"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before
    the assembled student body and faculty.'
  - Why?
  - Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride?
    What a waste.
- - Re-configure the leads?
  - Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
- - Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
  - The strain was evident.
- - I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we
    need is a vaccine for death itself.
  - Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
- - In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic
    as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed
    sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter
    and verse.  Any questions?
  - But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical
    works.
  - Philosophical?
  - Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
- - Paracelsus?
  - Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
  - What is your name?
  - Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
  - Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine?
    Or mysticism?
- - You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
  - Despite the lack of challenge.
- - Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and
    wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
  - And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart
    was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
- - I have always loved him.
  - Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime
    of passion?
  - Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing
    could never have entered my mind.
  - So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen
    in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning
    following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your
    possession?
  - I have no knowledge of that.
- - I was just clearing my throat.
  - Very well then.
- - I am not mad.
  - As a march hare.
- - Are you having me on?
  - Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
- - Henry Clerval.
  - Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
  - I know. You have a way of making an impression.
- - Do you really think I'm mad?
  - Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools
    to speak.
- - Rich old ladies and their daughters?
  - Can you think of a better reason?
  - Quite a few.
  - Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
- - The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
  - You're a comfort to me, Henry.
  - What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
  - It's a letter to my father.
- - Now you've got him started.
  - These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs.
    Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered
    a new frontier of thought
  - '...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I''ve heard
    this speech before.'
  - But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're
    on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask
    the questions.
- - Only you would think of that!
  - Somebody has to!
- - And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
  - Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
- - They just caught the man who did it.
  - He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
  - They'll hang him all the same.
  - Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
- - Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
  - It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
- - You're making a scene!
  - Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
  - You can't. Death is God's will!
  - I resent God's monopoly.
  - That's blasphemy!
  - Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
  - All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
  - No. He had more important work.
  - There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time.
    Consider that.
- - Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended
    a single class.
  - I've been preoccupied.
  - We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But
    it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
  - That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in
    Waldman's memory.
  - How much longer?
  - Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
- - This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
  - Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now.
    Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
  - Yes? And?
  - Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most
    of us are getting out while we still can.
  - You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry.
    Goodbye.
- - Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might
    lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
  - A... week?
  - We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion
    and some idiot running around in a storm.
  - Is that your diagnosis?
  - Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The
    rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for
    that just now.
  - You've been going round-the-clock?
  - We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
  - Everything in moderation, Clerval.
  - Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
- - It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll
    be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
  - No. They don't.
  - Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
- - Quite a place.
  - Thank you, Henry.
  - For what?
  - This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
- - What happened up there?
  - I didn't find what I was looking for.
- - Are you sure you'll be all right?
  - Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
  - I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend
    down together.
  - Only if you'll tell me who he is.
  - I owe you that. Done.
- - All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
  - Let it go.
- - I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty
    years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
  - You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
  - I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded
    secrets.
  - Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
  - No. But someday.
  - Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
- - Professor?
  - Oh God.
- - It's going to ram us.
  - It wouldn't dare.
- - Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
  - They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
  - Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
- - A warming wind.
  - This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
  - He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have
    the body removed from my cabin.
  - Aye, Captain.
- - Don't cry, Elizabeth.
  - Aren't you?
- - Are you sure it can't hurt us?
  - Nothing can. Not ever.
- - How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
  - It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
- - What kind of God is He to will this?
  - She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us
    now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I
    cannot do that alone.
  - God took her from us.
  - He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our
    very own. Your brother
- - Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
  - The world is a dizzying place.
- - Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
  - He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning
    to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
- - Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you
    believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
  - Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
- - Smell the air. Wonderful.
  - Quite a send-off, isn't it?
  - Father's so proud.
  - And you?
  - Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
  - I'll have to do better than that.
  - You will.  What do you want, Victor?
  - To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate
    disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
- - I've loved you all my life
  - All my life I've known.
- - This feels... incestuous.
  - Is that what makes it so delicious?
- - Brother and sister still?
  - I wish to be your husband.
  - I wish to be your wife.
  - Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
  - If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a
    child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
  - Only you.
  - I will be here when you return.
- - You make me weak.
  - Not as weak as I.
- - Our decision. Together.
  - Your decision. For us.
  - I give you my soul...
  - '...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.'
  - Victor. I love you,
  - Elizabeth. My more than sister.
- - My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his
    crimes... challenging me to come.
  - But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
  - I've no choice
  - If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
  - They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
- - Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
  - I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
- - I thought I'd never see you again!
  - I'm all right. I'm safe,
- - What sort of task?
  - It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
  - What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to
    live again.
  - So do I.
  - We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
  - A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved.
    I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You
    are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
- - No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
  - Why the change? What about your work?
  - It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
  - It is
  - We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
  - Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
  - Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
  - Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
  - I do. But you must trust me for now.
- - Brother and sister no more.
  - Now husband and wife.
- - I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom
    with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
  - I have been waiting for this ever since.
- - Victor!
  - Open this door for no-one!
- - He always was opinionated.
  - He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge
    of dissection lab!
- - What does it say?
  - Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home
    to marry me.
- - Have you seen Willie?
  - Is he not back yet?
  - Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
  - It's far too late for him to still be out.
- - Poor William! What indignant tears!
  - There, there... shhh...
- - That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
  - Quite right!
- - Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
  - Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
  - One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
- - You dance so beautifully together.
  - And you look so lovely.
- - Must've been a terrible row.
  - He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
- - Nothing. Still nothing.
  - It's been months. It's not like him.
  - Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from
    Hamburg.
  - So have I
  - I should go. I should leave today.
  - Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get
    near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
  - And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
  - Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll
    set his mind at ease.
- - Are you all right?
  - Fine.
- - Come warm yourself if you like.
  - You speak.
  - Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting
    for you. Two months now.
  - How did you find me?
- - The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds
    lovely.
  - Kill me and have done with it.
  - Kill you? Hardly that.
  - Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
  - More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say
    to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did
    I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness
    to promote me?
  - Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
  - Your crime... as well as mine.
  - How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
  - Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
  - I see it before me.
  - I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother...
    and my father abandoned me at birth.
- - Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
  - There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
  - What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these
    people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
  - Materials. Nothing more.
  - You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
- - In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In
    this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things
    remembered.
  - Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
  - Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful
    woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've
    seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who
    am I?
  - I don't know.
  - Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
- - What can I do?
  - There is something I want.  A friend.
  - Friend?
  - A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
  - Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
  - I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I
    have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes
    of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically
    indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion,
    Frankenstein.
  - And if I consent?
  - We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where
    no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human
    eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
- - Soon?
  - Yes. I want this over and done with.
  - I'll be waiting. And watching.
- - Why... her?
  - Her body pleases me.
- - What is this?
  - A brain. Extremities.
  - This was not taken from a grave.
  - What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
  - No. I draw the line.
- - You will honor your promise to me!
  - I will not! Kill me now!
  - That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll
    be with you on yours.
- - She's beautiful.
  - She's not for you.
  - I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
- - GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
  - SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
- - Nice.
  - The music? Or the fire?
- - I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
  - Better that way... for me.
  - Why?
  - I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
  - It can't be as bad as that.
  - Worse.
- - You're an outcast.
  - Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
  - Friends? Do they live around here?
  - Yes. Very close
  - Why do you not go to them?
- - I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly...
    and they are so very beautiful
  - People can be kinder than you think.
  - I am afraid.
- - You were with him at the end.
  - Yes.
  - I was watching.
- - I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could
    see you were a friend to him.
  - What is that to you? Evil as you are.
  - I am as he made me. In his own image.
  - You drove him to his torment.
  - And he drove me to mine.
  - Then why weep for him?
  - Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from
    his God. I from mine.
- - I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
  - What kindness?
  - Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
- - I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into
    a bull elephant.
  - Yeah?
  - I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred
    seventeen and no end in sight.
  - You're kidding.
  - Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
  - What?
  - '''Incurable.'''
- - And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
  - No!
  - Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of
    your children?
  - No!
  - Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who
    built the country?
  - No! No!
  - Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
- - I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives
    in attendance.
  - Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
  - Thanks are hardly necessary.
  - Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
  - I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
  - It ain't for lack of trying.
  - So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
  - Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
- - Oh! Are you really?
  - Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior
    is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that
    the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities
    which...
- - Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my
    personality than I do?
  - Please sit down...
  - You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like,
    but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse
    to a veternarian.
  - I see.
  - Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
  - And what's that?
  - Normal. Average.
  - All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
  - '...Did you really say that?'
  - Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
  - This whole thing is a joke!
  - Stay calm, please.
  - No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why,
    are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions...
    after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to
    shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks,
    won't you, "Doctor?"
  - I'll have someone show you to your room.
  - Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on
    your upper lip give you away.
- - Is there something else?
  - You didn't say 'Symington says'.
- - '...I''m sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your
    mother''s visit?'
  - Yes. It was very good to see her.
  - Really? Any problems?
- - Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers
    concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies.
    You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they
    put in me wasn't a mistake.
  - You're telling me you feel guilty.
  - No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with
    my life, that's all.
  - Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
  - What?
  - She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
  - I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny,
    and I said...
  - And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
  - Oh for Christ's...
- - I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
  - But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen
    and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
  - Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
  - Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward
    your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the
    staff review.
  - You what?
  - Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more...
    capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so
    short a time. Don't you agree?
- - I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
  - Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
  - Huh?
  - '''Cause if it''s long enough, which I doubt, why don''t you wrap it around and
    fuck yourself in the ass!'
- - I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there...
    you go back and you tell them to let me out!
  - Frances, I'm warning you...
  - No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your
    folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your
    badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
- - Symington says...
  - Sedate her.
- - On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
  - Excuse me.
  - Yes...?
  - Don't I know you?
  - I don't believe so.
  - Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
  - No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
  - Oh bullshit.
- - Mama...
  - I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
- - Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't
    refuse the label, understand?
  - Yes, Ma.
  - And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
- - But they're using you!
  - Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides,
    it's the only way I can get to New York.
- - I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables
    to the truck farmers, or --
  - Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
- - It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
  - Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma
    Styles --
  - I don't care.
  - '...You will.'
- - It's okay.
  - Smile, little sister, smile.
- - It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
  - Mama, what's...
  - Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my
    care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
  - You're taking me home!
- - Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
  - Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
- - And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
  - Why are these all opened?
  - Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense.
    You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
  - Then why did you bring them?
  - It's your fan mail, little sister.
  - You kill me, Mama.
  - What?
  - Go on...
- - Well, who have we here...?
  - Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
- - Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
  - Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
- - I think I need a little air.
  - What's wrong?
  - Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
  - Where are you going?
  - For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
- - How long will you be?
  - Not long.
- - I'll have lunch ready by one.
  - I'll be back.
  - At one. Promise?
  - Sure.
- - Say you promise.
  - I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
- - You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
  - Yes, Mama.
  - I don't want you drinking, Frances.
  - Yes, Mama.
- - I'm back, Mama.
  - Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
  - Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not
    going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after
    it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it
    nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something...
    simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and
    I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time
    in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
- - Don't... talk crazy.
  - Mama...?
  - They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending
    the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances,
    you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through
    this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've
    been answering!
- - Haven't you heard what I said?
  - I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing
    wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
  - I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My
    only responsibility is to myself now!
  - You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
  - No!
  - You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister.
    Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
  - Mama, shut up!
  - And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You
    know what that's like?!
  - You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
- - Where are you going?
  - I'm going out!
  - You're not going anywhere!
  - Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a
    grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
  - Frances!
- - Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
  - No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
- - Oh, just leave those things for now.
  - No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
- - You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the...
    the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
  - Thank you for understanding, Mama.
- - Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you
    to rest... for a while anyway.
  - I will, I promise.
- - Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
  - I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
  - You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish
    me! Support me!
  - I have!
- - No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm
    not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you
    too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane
    as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe
    me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got
    to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've
    done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
  - But what --
  - No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can
    pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of
    herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you
    because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see...
    I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little
    sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
- - And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
  - '''Golden Boy.'''
- - That's me, Clifford.
  - I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's
    not coming through. You're lazy --
- - I'm not!
  - Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set
    them on fire!
  - But I want to. I'm trying!
  - I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
  - Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
  - Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
- - '''But how do I know you love me?'''
  - Your big speech?
  - '''How do I know it''s true? You''ll get to be the champ. They''ll all want you,
    all the girls! But I don''t care. I''ve been undersea a long time. When they''d
    put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn''t it! This isn''t what I mean!"
    It''s been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you''re it! I don''t know
    why, I think you''re it. Take me home with you.'''
  - I already have.
- - How's it sound?
  - The speech? Real good.
  - You think I got it?
  - You got it.
  - Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
- - What happened? Who're you?
  - Who're you?
  - I live here.
  - You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel,
    I think.
  - What?
  - I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
- - '...Is that not true?'
  - Who's writing this guy's lines?
  - Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
  - No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
  - Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
  - I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
  - Did you expect him to look you up?
  - Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
- - You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
  - That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this,
    an audience or a jury?
  - Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
  - Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
  - Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of
    liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
- - Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation,
    coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order
    you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
  - Fine!
  - You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before
    it's too late.
- - Pretty morning.
  - It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
  - And no people.
  - Yes.
- - Where you goin'?
  - Wherever they're going, I'm going.
  - Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
  - Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
- - Yeah.
  - What'd you do?
  - You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
- - Shit!
  - Run!
- - Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
  - Don't touch me.
  - I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
- - Okay then...
  - Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
  - I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after
    me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know?
    Who the hell cares what I think?
  - Not me. But other people seem to.
  - Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
  - Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
  - No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
- - I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
  - Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
  - Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
  - Yeah, well --
  - You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
  - Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
  - Whattaya mean?
  - Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly
    neighborhood atheist --
  - But I'm not. The newspapers're --
  - Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin',
    see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours.
    Could look bad for your Daddy.
  - Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
- - Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
  - Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
  - 'I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep
    your trap shut.'
  - Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
  - Harry.
  - Harry.
- - Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
  - You think I'd miss it?
  - Well? What'd you think?
  - I just wanted to see how you looked.
  - How'd I look?
  - Enh.
  - Don't be a rat, Harry.
  - You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
- - Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone
    else looked stupid.
  - I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
  - Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
  - Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to
    go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
  - What?
  - Quietly.
  - You're not the quiet type, Frances.
- - You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement
    trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well,
    I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made
    me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
  - What happened to him?
  - He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
- - I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living
    his life.
  - '...So you think I should go.'
  - Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
  - I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
  - You don't know what you want.
  - Yeah.
- - Frances...
  - What?
  - Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
  - Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny
    dipping.  For starters.
- - How ya doin', Farmer?
  - Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
  - Came to get a tan.
- - Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
  - Kaminski.
  - Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
  - Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
  - What?
  - They killed him. They threw him out that window.
  - Oh no...
  - Eight stories.
- - Jesus.
  - Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn
    much heart. He just didn't want to die.
  - But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
  - He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want
    to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and
    nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
  - You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
- - Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
  - I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
  - I know what ability you're interested in.
  - Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to
    the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
  - Harry... I met someone.
  - Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
- - Serious, huh?
  - Yeah.
  - Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
- - Shit. I meant the other way around.
  - Well, the studio told me not to.
  - Is that why you did it?
  - Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there
    --
  - You're telling me.
  - Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
  - Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving.
    I think you better go back, kid.
  - Forget it.
- - 'You know, the funny thing is: it''s not a great movie. I mean it could''ve been,
    but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they''re
    going to smile and say they loved it.'
  - If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
  - No, they don't, do they?
- - Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get
    anything.
  - I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can
    I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
  - Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well
    see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
  - But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
  - What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile.
    You can do that, you know?
  - Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
- - Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in
    my beat up Chevy.
  - The hell you will, Harry York.
  - Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
- - Don't start, Farmer.
  - It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
  - The chauffeur. He's watching.
  - He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
  - I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
  - I know.
- - Harry? Harry, where are you?!
  - Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
  - I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that
    for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
  - Calm down, Frances.
  - Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
- - Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see
    you any more.' Just like that!
  - Frances...
  - Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate
    it!
- - How the hell do you find me anyway?
  - Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
  - What's left of my blood.
  - Think I'll have a glass.
  - Help yourself. Everyone else has.
- - Nice joint. Can you afford it?
  - Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
  - What for?
  - For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
  - Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
- - Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not
    going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
  - I took the early rounds.
  - I'll bet.
  - I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they
    just hurt.
  - So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
  - 'Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what''s going
    on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that
    happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?'
  - Beats me.
- - Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me,
    stay a few days?
  - No, Harry, I can't --
  - You're coming.
- - 'I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something
    that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something
    good.'
  - And?
  - Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the
    ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing
    you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top...
    and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're
    just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
- - Take a walk, pal.
  - Who said I was a lady?
- - Oh my God, I look awful.
  - You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
- - Evening, gorgeous.
  - That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the
    wheel?
  - Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
  - Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
- - Where are we, mean man?
  - Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with
    a ranch.
  - I should've known...
  - What?
  - This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
  - That's right.
  - '...Take advantage of me.'
- - I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
  - Whattaya think you're in now?
  - I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
  - Huh?
  - A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring
    war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
- - Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
  - Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think
    put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking
    it as long as it suits her.
  - No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
  - Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
- - You know something, Harry?
  - I guess.
  - Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong
    with you.
  - What's that?
  - You can't drink.
- - Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
  - Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
  - What a man!
  - Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
  - To quarter-horses.
  - No. To thoroughbreds.
- - Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
  - Huh?
  - You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
  - 'Look, Frances, I''m only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this,
    I''ll never ask again: Will you marry me?'
  - I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone,
    Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail
    you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take.
    Do you understand?
  - Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
- - There's just one more thing.
  - What's that?
  - Will you marry me?
- - It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
  - Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just...
    I can't give up on her that easy.
  - You give up on her?
  - Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
  - Frances, You're crazy.
  - I know. Don't tell anyone.
- - Anyway... if you need me...
  - I got your number, Mister Man.
- - Frances! Frances!
  - Who?
  - Frances, it's me, Harry?
  - '...Touch me again and I''ll kill you, you pig.'
- - I love you, Harry. I love you.
  - I love you too, Frances.
- - Where to?
  - Oh Harry...
- - This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
  - Yeah. I don't know.
  - You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets
    or your mother. You need me.
  - I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned
    around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder,
    touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now...
    anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
- - Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like
    a sap.
  - Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's
    just... Can't you wait for me?
  - I don't know.
  - Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever
    it takes.
  - Right. Except... time has a way of --
  - No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll
    come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
  - I hope so, Frances.
- - C'mere. I want to talk to you.
  - Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
- - How... how ya doin', Farmer?
  - Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
  - Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
  - How did I look?
  - Oh, you...  ...ennh.
  - Well... you're looking well.
- - I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
  - Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
  - Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
  - Why do you say that?
  - I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry.
    Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
- - It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
  - I'm not sure.
  - Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
  - No.
  - No, we're not.
- - Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
  - Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
  - That would be okay.
  - Just a little way.
- - I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
  - You can always come see it in London.
  - Only if you were in it. Are you?
  - I wouldn't miss it.
  - Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
  - Are you an actor?
  - Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California,
    here I come!
  - Are you really serious? About acting?
  - Why... yes.
  - Then don't go to Hollywood.
  - Why?
  - I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the
    place. It'll crush you.
  - You sound as if you hate it.
  - No, I don't hate it.
- - Aren't you ever going back?
  - '...Not if I can help it.'
  - Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
  - They'll mend.
  - What about your husband?
- - What?
  - Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
  - What is this?
- - Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
  - Why, you... you little bastard!
- - Just one minute...
  - You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
- - Name?
  - I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and
    you don't even know who the hell I am!
- - Age?
  - Fifteen.
  - Address?
  - Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault
    and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
  - Occupation?
- - Kurt!
  - Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
  - But, Kurt, I...
  - No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest,
    and you know what I have to do!
  - Oh, Kurt!
  - Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
- - It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
  - I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
- - Bread?
  - Thank you.
  - When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
- - You're poisoning that child's mind.
  - I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand
    why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
  - You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists
    and indigents --
  - They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
  - How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists!
    Traitors!
  - No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
  - That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man
    who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
- - I'm going back to the hotel.
  - Good.
  - See you next weekend?
  - As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
- - Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
  - Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
  - That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
- - Bye, baby.
  - See you next weekend, Dad.
- - I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
  - Thanks, Dad.
  - An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
  - I didn't have much to do with it.
  - You wrote it, didn't you?
  - Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
  - Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
  - He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
  - Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right
    now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square
    break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when
    it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
  - Is Kaminski a Communist?
  - No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
  - He's a socialist, then?
- - It's already started, Dad... with me.
  - I know.
  - And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain
    --
- - Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
  - Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
- - What do I do, Dad?
  - You really want to go?
  - Of course.
  - And you think it's worth all this?
  - If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
  - '...Then go.'
- - I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
  - Be careful, Francie.
- - '...So what do you think?'
  - I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
  - I know that, Dad, but --
  - What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much
    for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever
    saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been...
    if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
  - But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
  - Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just
    doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold
    onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things,
    but I guess you already know that.
  - Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
  - Always. Always.
- - I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
  - I don't care, Dad. I love you.
  - I love you too, Francie.
- - Francie, you know I can't do that.
  - Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road
    and you never have to see me again.
  - They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
- - Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped
    out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
  - But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are
    tied.
- - You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute,
    slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
  - Please, Francie...
  - Daddy!
- - Are you... are you hungry?
  - I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
- - '...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental
    institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?'
  - '...No, Ralph. I don''t believe I ever was sick. But when you''re treated like
    a patient long enough, you''re apt to act like one...'
- - Were you an alcoholic?
  - No.
  - Were you a drug addict?
  - No. Never.
- - Thank you, Ralph.
  - Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your
    friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
- - 'This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is
    a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!'
  - But I'll never win that.
  - 'Yes, yes, it''s all arranged. Everyone''s collecting subscriptions in your name.
    And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.'
  - Really?
  - New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
  - Thank you.
- - Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's
    just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had
    lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to
    get on with it.
  - I know you believe that.
  - '...Don''t you?'
  - 'I''m afraid not. You see, we observe things that you''re unaware of: signs, indicators.
    Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff
    so that when you do get out, you''ll really feel secure. Does that make sense?'
- - No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
  - Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
  - You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to
    get out of here?
  - Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on
    your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
  - '...I see.'
  - We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
  - One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
- - Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home,
    Harry.
  - We'll get you home, Frances.
  - Thank you, Harry.
- - Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
  - The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
  - Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
  - I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll
    clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
- - Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
  - Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told
    you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
- - Harry!
  - I gotta go now.
- - We're all square now, Harry. Right?
  - All square, Doc.
  - Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
- - You learn your lines?
  - Sort of.
  - There've been some calls.
  - Who?
  - Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's
    her name?
  - Claire?
  - Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
  - Fired?
  - Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
- - There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is
    all set. So you're going back east, huh?
  - '...Yes.'
  - Without me.
  - Showdown.
  - You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
  - Dick, we need some time apart --
  - Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and
    when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
  - Dick, I can't even breathe here...
  - Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
  - Dick...
  - I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might
    want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason
    has nothing to do with summer stock.
  - No?
  - No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
  - What night?
  - The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell
    me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
  - You want his name?
- - Hey, where's the fire, sister?
  - In my eyes, officer.
  - Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war
    on, you know?
  - Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without
    my headlights?
  - I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
- - Get your clothes on.
  - You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of
    here --
  - Get your clothes on, lady --
  - GET OUT!
  - You're under arrest.
- - The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our
    approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual
    and an instrument of change. You see --
  - Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
  - Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those
    who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most
    of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
  - Who is she?
- - '...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world
    around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its
    wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute
    our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe,
    jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital,
    must be a soldier too.'
  - I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
- - Hello, Harold.
  - Frances.
  - Where's Clifford?
  - He's not here.
  - Oh.
- - What's up?
  - I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
  - That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
  - Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
- - You don't think I'm good enough?
  - What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we
    found it.
  - Who?
  - An actress.
  - A rich actress.
  - Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
  - But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says...
    This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about
    what greed and money do to people!
  - I know, but --
  - What does Clifford say?
  - Right now we have to be practical.
  - Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where
    is he?
  - He knows, Frances.
- - Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
  - I'm not!
  - You're afraid!
  - I'm not!
  - You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you
    don't want to show it --
  - God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things!
    I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so
    shut up!
- - Good, good. Give them that.
  - What?
- - Madam...?
  - Thank you.
- - Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in
    Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
  - Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
- - Okay, but come here first.
  - Huh.
  - Come here. I want to show you something.
- - Hi Frances, got a minute?
  - Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
- - Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
  - My clothes?
  - Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
  - It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
  - Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something
    different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
  - I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
  - You know what I mean.
  - Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And
    drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't
    so! Not a real person!
- - That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears
    you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
  - Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about
    his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
  - I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
  - I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the
    director directs, and the actress...'
  - '...acts. I''ll relay your message.'
- - That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
  - 'You see: We''ve got to change that name.'
- - I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties...
    Garbo, Dietrich --
  - Thank you --
  - I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
- - Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going
    to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
  - Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
  - Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
- - Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their
    jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and
    I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs
    head-lights, now can I?
  - But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
  - No, I'm concerned with everything.
  - But I'm the one up there on the screen.
  - That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
- - Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back,
    and I'm gonna make the best of it.
  - I'd like nothing better.
- - Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
  - Who's this?
  - Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
  - Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
  - I guess so, sir.
  - Very fine bone structure.
- - And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out
    of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
  - I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
  - Excuse me, sir?
  - I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
- - Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million
    beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
  - That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this
    studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that
    young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
  - Oh. I mean, good.
  - I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly
    Louella Parsons!
- - Well... come on.
  - This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
  - Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it
    up!
  - But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home
    and change.
  - 'Look, Frances, I didn''t want this job. Think I''m crazy? But you begged me:
    improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?'
  - You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
  - Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat
    off.
  - So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
  - Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
- - Frances?  Oh no.
  - Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
  - What're you doing?
  - Putting on my armor.
  - Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you
    out.
  - Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
  - Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted
    these people to forgive you.
  - '''Forgive''...? For What?'
  - I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
- - Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
  - Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where
    ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
- - Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
  - Um, well...
  - Are you lying to me?
  - Well...
  - What did we say about lying?
  - I'm not lying.
  - You know that no one likes a liar, right?
  - I said I'm not lying.
- - What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
  - I just hit it like you said.
- - Oh my God... What is that?
  - That's one piece of four problems.
- - Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move!
    Mommy's coming!
  - Stop her!
- - Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus...
    Never, ever, never let you go.
  - Let's lock off this room.
- - Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now.
    No idea.  I'm ready.
  - All right.
- - You know you don't have to do this.
  - I'm fine, I really am.
  - I admire your strength.
  - We all have to be strong, right?
  - Right.
- - Her name is Charlie.
  - Oh...
  - She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for
    the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
  - I'll do anything to help.
  - I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
  - Deal.
- - We should stick together out there.
  - I'd love to.
- - Did we make it?
  - I think --
- - If you are face to face with her, dive left.
  - And the last one is the...
  - Father. The biggest, the strongest...
- - Okay, well that's something.
  - So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
- - There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
  - That's fine.
- - Hold it!
  - Whoa!
- - Let's go!
  - Wait God-dammit!
- - If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
  - Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there,
    right?
- - Go! Go!
  - Not without you!!!
  - Go!!!
- - Get to your cars!
  - GO-GO-GO!!
- - Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
  - Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition
    here? Anything at all?
- - What's wrong?
  - Nothing, just lookin'.
- - Let's go.
  - She's not very nice, is she?
- - DON'T!
  - YOU'LL HIT US!
- - Let's wait it out.
  - They'll tear this place down within the hour.
- - Well, maybe they migrate?
  - As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard,
    and then attack.
- - Hey!
  - Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare
    up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta
    here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
- - Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
  - Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
- - Yeah, I'll go.
  - Ok. Let's see what happens.
- - Let's move.
  - I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
- - You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and
    ensure it explodes when you throw it.
  - You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
  - I'm sure.
- - HELP MEEE!
  - BONSAI!
- - I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
  - Amazing you made it this far.
- - Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out
    of here together.
  - Am I too heavy for you?
  - Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
- - OH JESUS!
  - HELLLPPP!
- - Got 'cha!
  - HOLD THAT TIGHT!
- - '''Eh, Chief?'
  - Duh hickey.
- - Fine, Chief.
  - Gimme the keys.
  - NO, but I will lock you in.
  - What?
  - We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the
    only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
- - You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
  - Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
  - Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
- - What?!
  - Move slow and move quiet.
  - No shit.
- - Move it!
  - You keep that key handy.
- - Shit!
  - I'm fine! I'm fine!
- - JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
  - If he doesn't shut up...
- - Hurry!
  - REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS
    TAV--!
- - SHIT.
  - MOVE YOUR ASS!
- - COME ON!
  - HELLLLLLLLP!!
- - Yeah, maybe.
  - Get something on that.
- - Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
  - There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where
    that is?
- - Welcome back.
  - F-f-fuck you.
- - They were all over the place.
  - You smell like ass!
- - Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group.
    Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
  - Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
- - Bullshit.
  - No bullshit.
- - Clever fuckers.
  - What the hell's going on here!?
- - Blow the goddamn hatch!
  - Clear!
- - What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
  - Get outta here.
- - This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
  - Whoa!
- - You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
  - Oh? And what's that?
  - Sit still, look less like a meal.
  - I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
- - I wouldn't do that, son.
  - They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the
    road. They'd be easy.
- - I'll go with ya.
  - What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
- - My husband...
  - Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
  - He's dead.
  - What?
- - Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
  - Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before.
    Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of
    your patrons like they were Kleenex.
  - So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and
    there are angry creatures outside?
  - He only shot you once.
  - Huh?
  - He shot you the other time.
- - Will these boards hold?
  - The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath.
    Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of
    the beasts.
  - Good.
- - In the kitchen, under the sink.
  - No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
- - Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency
    frequency. But I don't see the point.
  - You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
- - What?
  - What?
  - What do you mean what?
  - Huh?
  - What's going on between you two?
  - Nothing.
- - What's it for!?
  - Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in.
    The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
  - Is it gassed up?
  - Fully.
  - Four door?
  - Two.
  - Open?
  - Covered.
  - How many?
  - Holds four.
  - Max?
  - Seven.
  - Nine?
  - Seven.
  - Keys.
  - What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No
    way! That's my god damn truck!
  - Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
  - I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
- - How are you holding up?
  - Well...
- - Push and twist, it's child proof.
  - Oh.
  - Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
- - What is this?
  - Magic potion.  You should try a little.
  - Oh, no.
  - It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
  - Really?
  - Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
  - Will I go crazy or something?
  - No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off
    like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
  - Why not then?
- - Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's
    a cot back there.
  - But --
  - It's much safer in there, sweety.
  - Okay then.
- - Doesn't your foot hurt?
  - I can't feel a thing, Hon.
- - Um-hmmm.
  - The girl's got rhythm.
- - You wanna see, baby?
  - Sure.
  - How much you got?
  - How much I got, what?
- - How much you got to see the show?
  - You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free.
    But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
- - What? Really?
  - Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I
    wanna do some appraising.
- - I'm in.
  - Anyone else?
- - We're going to get help.
  - We gotta try.
  - Anybody else?
- - We gotta be close.
  - What?
- - All right!  Tell us about the truck!
  - Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
- - My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in
    the front and we roll out of here.
  - What's in the back?
  - Nothing, this was my last delivery.
- - Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
  - But not flush against the tunnel?
- - It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
  - Just cover me. It was built to move.
- - Why do you take shit from him?
  - Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
  - Your brother, huh?
  - Yep.
  - Your parents of relation?
  - We lived near power lines.
- - So, what now? Did those things leave?
  - Why don't you go check it out?
  - Fuck no.
- - Any more ideas Animal Planet?
  - You weren't helpin'.
  - Go douche.
- - I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
  - Oh yeah?
- - Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you
    stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see
    a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
  - Well then I guess we should just give up.
  - Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not
    in the cards, partner.
- - We're better off.
  - Who's with me?
- - Come on!
  - He's dead.
- - What now, Geronimo?
  - My truck.
- - You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
  - Fuck you too.
  - Get in line!
- - Scared?
  - No. You?
  - Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
- - I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
  - The door... on three.
- - Ohhh.
  - What?
  - Look.
- - That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
  - Just an observation.
  - Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
- - That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little
    one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more
    than makes up for in speed.
  - And the rest of 'em?
  - Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
- - And that's how I ended up here.
  - And the head?
- - So, your husband ditched you?
  - No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He
    didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
  - Well, justice is funny.
- - They're right here.
  - Hey!
- - Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
  - Easy.
- - Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out
    --
  - There's a tunnel.
- - What tunnel? Where?
  - It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside
    of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
  - What's it for?
- - HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going
    with him.
  - What!? I'm not going down there again!
  - This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out
    the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them...
    we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
  - This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
- - You all sure about this?
  - Follow me.
- - Where's the tunnel?
  - In the corner, behind the curtain.
- - We just smeared a skunk.
  - Shit!
- - I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
  - Just move!
- - You seem mighty collected about this.
  - Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't
    been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this
    is just another Tuesday.
- - Hey! Get quiet or get out.
  - C'mon guys--
- - I think I know where a CB is.
  - Where's that?
  - Upstairs.
- - Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
  - Come on, come on.
- - Oh!
  - '"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?'
- - Wha?
  - OPEN THE DOOR!
- - You got something better?
  - If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
- - We'll be food, dickheads!
  - Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
  - You gotta be with me on this.
- - One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
  - Gonna stay for a couple?
- - I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
  - Who the hell would you call?
  - Anyone.
- - Stop it.
  - Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
- - We shot a skunk.
  - We're lucky to be alive.
- - IS IT CLEAR?!
  - Yeah.
  - IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
  - Nah, I got the gun.
- - My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
  - Her fella.
- - Well, it don't look pretty.
  - But it's got teeth.
- - I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got
    another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes
    of shells for The Judge.
  - I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
- - I don't think you should...
  - With what just happened upstairs --
- - You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
  - We can't risk letting them in.
  - Right.
- - Careful.
  - I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
- - I will not die because of him!
  - Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
- - We should go! We should go right now!
  - He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
- - Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made
    it!
  - They'll be back.
  - Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
- - You know where it is?
  - Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
- - We'll meet in three hours?
  - I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
- - Where are you two going?
  - We're going to get my little girl.
- - Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
  - Where is everyone?
  - I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
- - It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
  - Spare me.
  - I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged
    your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on
    the eye.
- - Stop!
  - What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
  - They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
- - YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
  - They'll get in! We'll all die!
- - You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
  - I don't know what you're talking about!
  - Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
  - Part of what?
- - Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
  - No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
- - In that case, maybe she can help.
  - Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
- - What?
  - One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't
    add up, that's our problem.
- - Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
  - You and a lot of other people.
- - Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another
    of these little incidents, will we?
  - Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
  - Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
- - May I see your license.
  - Of course, officer.
- - Could I have that, please?
  - Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
- - You realize...
  - Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it
    anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
  - That's a strange attitude.
- - You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead.
    Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
  - A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't
    even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
- - Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended
    you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next
    rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap.
    Do I make myself clear?
  - How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
  - Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area.
    Can you make it that far?
  - I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about
    it.
- - Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
  - YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
- - What made you do it? Who paid you off?
  - Nobody. I'm the maid!
- - The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're
    here?
  - I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear!
    All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
- - Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
  - No! I swear I'm not!
- - You'd pay me for that?
  - You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody
    -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
  - Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
- - 'The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say
    "I fear nothing."'
  - I fear nothing.
- - '"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."'
  - One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
- - We're your friends. We're not like the others.
  - No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
- - If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because
    it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to
    some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like
    dogs...
  - Jesus! Did I say that?
  - Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
  - It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
- - God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're
    going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney
    I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that,
    the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco
    shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you --
    and we'll have to arm ourselves.
  - Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
- - I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to
    ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
  - Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
- - O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located
    a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the
    gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking
    to?
  - Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest
    equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated
    shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
  - We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
  - We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency
    of the white man's culture.
- - '...and we''re chock full of that!'
  - Damn right!
  - My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
- - He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying
    to me.
  - My heart!
- - Where's the medicine?
  - The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
- - Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity!
    Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
  - You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of
    Journalism!
  - What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
  - Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
  - The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've
    known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
- - Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
  - And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country
    when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
- - Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
  - God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our
    cocaine, you pig!
  - You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean
    before morning.
  - You whore!
- - How long do I have?
  - Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed.
    It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal.
    Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent
    to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
  - Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
- - Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting
    for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
  - Lacerda?
- - I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze
    to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
  - If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
- - I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up
    to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked!
    He knows we're onto him!
  - But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
- - That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's
    get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
  - No, no. Don't leave me!
- - Shoot it.
  - Not yet. I want to study its habits.
- - What are you talking about?
  - You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three
    minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about
    reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the
    cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
- - That's good...
  - I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
  - They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
- - Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two
    good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good
    people!
  - How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty-
    nine cent hotdogs...
  - Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the
    job?
  - To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for
    twenty dollars!
- - Why?
  - Why what?
- - Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
  - What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
- - Jesus creeping shit!
  - Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
  - We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
- - This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
  - Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
- - 'Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What''s happening here? What''s
    going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.'
  - Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks;
    I was born... Born?
  - Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain
    Zeep.
- - I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
  - Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the
    vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
  - That's what gives me The Fear.
  - Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
  - Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much
    money can you lend me?
  - Not much. Why?
  - I have to go.
  - GO?
  - Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
  - Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
  - No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
  - OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
  - Can we make it?
  - That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
  - I want to leave fast.
  - OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
  - Do they pay you to screw that bear?
- - When does this thing stop?
  - It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
- - Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
  - Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
  - Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
  - Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in
    a steel box and take us down to the basement.
- - Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
  - You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
- - Yeah... I thought we might need it...
  - What for?
- - Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
  - No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding
    us for some reason.
  - Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching
    us like a hawk.
  - He told me he was turning in early...
- - That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
  - That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
  - That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
- - Where'd you get that knife?
  - Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
  - What limes?
  - They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
- - Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
  - Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put
    the car in the lot.
- - You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because
    if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
  - Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
  - What tape?
  - Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
  - You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up
    here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
  - I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
  - OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all
    I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a
    very difficult day.
- - 'Of course, I''m your attorney, I''ll give you all the time you need, at my normal
    rates: $45 an hour -- but you''ll be wanting a cushion, so, why don''t you just
    lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?'
  - How about a check?
  - Whatever's right.
- - I want that fucking radio!
  - Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
  - Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can
    go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head
    off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
- - Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd
    make me explain it!
  - BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
  - Jesus.
  - Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
- - Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of
    the goddamn maids to do it.
  - Are you ready?
- - You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
  - Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five
    minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
  - You cheap honky sonofabitch...
  - Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you
    want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
  - The cops?
  - There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with
    a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
  - Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your
    forehead. Nothing serious.
- - You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
  - What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
  - What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your
    ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish
    testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
  - You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about
    to leave for the airport.
- - You degenerate pig!
  - It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
- - WELL? What are your plans?
  - Plans?
  - Lucy.
  - Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little
    blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak...
    Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
  - Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at
    the drug convention.
- - Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six
    months. It's terrible.
  - She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her
    into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back
    street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs
    loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
- - Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say
    that kind of stuff.
  - It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand
    a day.
  - NO! Stop talking like that.
  - I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid
    that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
  - You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
  - In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering
    Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel
    Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
    penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
- - NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
  - You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll
    send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
- - 'The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to
    the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect:
    My attorney.'
  - We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call
    the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
  - What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
  - It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about
    us is completely worthless.
  - Us?
- - Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
  - I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
- - I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I
    told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out
    here and rip his lungs out.
  - That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
  - As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
  - Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
  - Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a
    powerful lust for red salmon...
- - I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like
    this. Not hundreds of them!
  - They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
  - Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
  - Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
  - This is a fucking nightmare.
  - Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and
    put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
- - Read the newspapers.
  - Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts
    gone crazy for human sacrifice!
- - Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people
    every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street
    if they have to.
  - Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's
    hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of
    people watching, too!
- - What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe
    three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
  - They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
  - Like big lizards.
  - '...and every one of them stacked naked...'
- - Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
  - They were all veterans.
- - What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
  - Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
- - Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down
    the line.
  - We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.
    Not with the press around.
- - Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
  - They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
- - Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
  - Lucy is looking for you.
  - No, she's looking for you.
  - Me?
  - She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying
    you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out
    of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won.
    That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
- - OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right.
    She's my problem.
  - It's gone too far.
  - Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As
    your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown
    bottle in my shaving kit.
- - What is this?
  - You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline
    seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
- - Adrenochrome...
  - Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard
    a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering
    anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all
    his teeth out...
  - I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head
    full of acid."
- - I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a
    moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being
    attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
  - Where'd you get this?
  - Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
  - Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only
    one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
- - I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism
    freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever
    been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have
    an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
    to chew on.
  - I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination
    of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
- - Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
  - Some of what?
  - Extract of pineal!
  - Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something
    out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
  - Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred
    pounds in two hours...
  - Right!
  - '...grow claws... bleeding warts.'
  - Yes!
  - '...then you''d notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...'
- - Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
  - FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
- - So do we, lady.
  - I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
  - Do you think you can handle it?
- - Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be
    posing as a politician.
  - Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every
    month.
- - Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
  - Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
- - There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
  - Two glasses of ice water with ice.
- - I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
  - How much is the lemon meringue pie?
  - Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor
    survival level.
- - What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
  - We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the
    tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility
    that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer
    down on us could possibility believe it.
- - The airport is over there!
  - Never missed a plane yet.
- - No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
  - Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up.
    You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles.
    I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license
    plate. You ready?
  - Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
- - Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can
    always send a telegram to the Right People.
  - Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
- - I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just
    some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan.
    But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
  - Hell, no!
  - I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable
    to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
  - What?
  - Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago
    we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
- - Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
  - Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
- - Where ya comin' from, young man?
  - Las Vegas.
  - A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
  - I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
  - That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
- - Oh, my God!...
  - This is my granddaughter...
  - Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just
    another good American like yourself.
- - I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
  - You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom
    apart.
  - Naw!
  - They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives.
    They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
  - Not down in my parts.
- - What happened? What did they do to her?
  - Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking
    lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
  - And nobody did anything?
- - Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
  - A major!
  - We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
  - Naw! Not a major.
  - He wanted the pineal gland.
  - Really?
  - That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
- - Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California
    seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back
    when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under
    surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's
    safe.
  - You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this
    scum.
  - What do you mean by that?
  - You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
- - Rum and ice, please.
  - You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us
    about dope fiends.
  - They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like
    warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it
    was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
  - Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
- - Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
  - Not where we operate.
- - Naked!?
  - Naked.
- - Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
  - WHAT?
- - Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
  - Dobermans don't talk.
  - What?
- - Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody
    named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
  - Yes... It makes sense.
- - I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured
    he might be part of your team.
  - He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
- - What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When
    we knew he was right here in the hotel.
  - You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the
    time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
  - Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
  - Awake? What do you mean?
- - Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem
    likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a
    chat and a handshake, you understand.
  - Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten
    breakfast. He's a very crude man.
- - But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
  - Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him.
    Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have
    to get out to the track.
  - There's no hurry! The race is over!
  - Not for me.
- - Let's have lunch!
  - Righto!
- - Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
  - Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a
    fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn.
    "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room
    for you."
- - Certainly, Mr. Duke!
  - My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone
    drive it around to the room?
- - Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's
    worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
  - Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
  - Well, thank you.
- - What's the message? My light is blinking.
  - 'Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room
    1600."'
  - Holy shit!
- - Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought
    I should call again, because I was wondering...
  - WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are
    being killed!
  - Killed?
  - IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
  - Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
  - Tell me. What do you want?
- - The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was
    crying...
  - Crying? Why was she crying?
  - Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police
    Convention...
  - Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching
    her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment,
    but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
  - Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
  - Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any
    other human being in trouble.
  - What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible
    then?
  - Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
- - Are you ready to order here?
  - Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the
    same.
  - Anything to drink?
  - Two Cokes.
  - Okay. Thanks.
- - Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
  - I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
- - What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
  - We keep them.
  - You keep them.
  - We keep them, in case the people come back.
- - What's your other question?
  - My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
- - Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
  - Oh... yes.
- - Thanks for coming to get me.
  - Sure thing.
- - This is a nice car.
  - Yeah. It's my sister's.
- - Do you have Mrs. George for English?
  - Yeah. She is pretty good.
  - Yeah. She is pretty good.
- - Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
  - I've heard that, too.
- - Do you know what you want?
  - I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
  - Excellent.
- - Are you all right?
  - Oh yeah.
- - Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
  - Not at all.
- - Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
  - Two more Cokes.
- - I had a really nice time tonight.
  - Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
- - I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
  - Do you want to come inside?
  - Aren't your parents asleep?
  - No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
  - Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
- - Where's your brother?
  - I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
  - No. That's okay.
  - Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
  - Naw. I don't mind.
- - So... pretty nice house you've got here.
  - Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
- - I don't know.
  - Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and
    stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
  - Sure.
- - This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
  - Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
- - '...I''ve got to go home.'
  - Do you really have to go?
  - Well... it's getting kind of late.
- - Where's Mike today?
  - Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
  - What's April 16th?
  - It's John Bonham's birthday.
  - John Bonham?
  - John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday
    he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own
    holiday.
  - Oh. I see.
- - I made a fool of myself.
  - Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone
    comes out, we'll blend back in.
  - What about the notes?
  - I'll get you the notes.
- - Hi, Mark.
  - Hi, Stacy. How are you?
  - I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something.
    I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this
    year.
- - Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
  - I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
- - Really?
  - Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And
    so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
- - Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how
    much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
  - I'd like that.
- - You look like you could still be in high school.
  - I know, everyone says that.
- - What can I get for you tonight.
  - How about your phone number?
- - Thanks for picking me up.
  - No problem.
- - '''The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.''  You look nice tonight.'
  - Thanks. So do you.
  - Where do you feel like going?
  - I don't know. Wherever you want.
  - How about the point?
  - The point sounds fine.
  - All right, the point it is.
- - That's a nice shirt.
  - Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- - It's very warm out tonight.
  - It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
- - Are you really nineteen?
  - Yes... I am really nineteen.
- - I think I better take you home.
  - What about those other guys you live with?
  - No. I mean back to your home.
- - Is this your first time?
  - Yes.
- - Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
  - What class?
  - This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
  - Really?
- - Can I come in?
  - Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't
    see all my kids here.
- - Mr. Spicoli?
  - That's the name they gave me.
- - You just ripped my card in two!
  - Yes.
  - Hey, bud. What's your problem?
- - Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
  - Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
  - I couldn't make it in time.
  - You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
  - I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
  - Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class,
    Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
  - I don't know.
- - Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
  - Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
  - Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance
    in my class and on my time.
  - I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't
    that make it our time?
- - You better save some for me, you swine!
  - And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this
    week.
- - Mr... Mr. Hand.
  - That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
- - Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
  - Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
  - I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
  - Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
- - Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
  - I don't know. I guess so.
  - Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained
    to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning
    of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students,
    or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
- - Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of
    squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about
    the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution
    in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
  - Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
  - Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
- - I think I've made my point with you tonight.
  - Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
  - What's that?
  - Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of.
    Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
  - Well, you'll find out next year.
  - No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side
    of the building.
  - If you graduate.
  - You're gonna flunk me?!
- - Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
  - All right! Oh, yeah!
- - Aloha, Mr. Hand!
  - Aloha, Spicoli.
- - How's it going.
  - Do you think that guy's cute?
- - Don't you like him?
  - Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
  - Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
  - What should I do?
  - Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny,
    laugh a lot.
- - He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
  - Should we buy a frame for that?
  - Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started
    working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this
    week?
  - Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken.
    Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I
    gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They
    don't call.
  - So what did you do?
  - I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd
    sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab
    him.
  - I can't do that.
- - Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just...
    wussies.
  - Really?
  - Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen.
    It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
  - He was hot, wasn't he?
  - If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
- - I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
  - Believe it.
- - I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
  - No way! He just called him a dick.
  - God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
- - Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
  - I know.
- - Do you think guys find that attractive?
  - Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
- - Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in
    bed.
  - What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
  - No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
  - What variables?
  - Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
  - What's the big deal?
  - Well I never did it.
  - There's nothing to it.
- - Just kidding. About 10cc.
  - Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
- - Was it great?
  - It was okay.
  - You'll always remember your first time.
  - It was nice.
  - So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
  - Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
  - Hey! That's my line!
- - There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's
    since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after
    I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
  - Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
  - Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
  - Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm
    marrying him.
  - If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
  - Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
- - You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling...
    then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
  - I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
  - I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
  - Not since November.
- - Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
  - Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You
    want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and
    he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
- - I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever
    take me out.
  - Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful...
    someday.
  - Thanks a lot.
- - What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
  - Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
  - Sixteen.
- - I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
  - You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and
    all these quizzes. It's like school.
  - Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
- - Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
  - Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
  - Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
  - You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
  - All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your
    mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
  - Climax together.
  - Does that ever happen?
  - No. But it's a nice idea.
  - Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't
    have real orgasms.'
- - How long does Doug take?
  - I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
  - What's Doug do in Chicago?
  - He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
- - What do you think?
  - I think they're both virgins.
- - I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
  - No.
- - God, he hardly even talks anymore.
  - I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
- - Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
  - God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
- - God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
  - I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
- - You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
  - I don't know... I just don't feel right.
- - What do you think it is?
  - What do you think it is?
  - It couldn't be.
  - It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess
    it was Damone.
  - Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
  - I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
  - But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone
    to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
- - You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
  - What?
  - You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with
    them and they start acting like they're five years old.
  - You're right. I didn't tell you that.
- - I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
  - That little prick.
  - Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his
    father.
  - That little prick.
  - I paid for it and everything.
  - There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick.
    I'm not letting him get away with this.
  - Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the
    guy.
  - Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
- - Another summer of working at Swenson's.
  - Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
  - You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can
    have sex.
  - What do you want?
  - I want romance.
  - Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
- - Where's Doug?
  - He's not coming.
  - Not coming? What happened?
  - He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
  - Sometime?
  - Yeah, like maybe never.
  - But what are you going to do?
  - Well I might go to Dartmouth.
  - Dartmouth?!
  - I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
  - I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
  - There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
  - Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
- - Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
  - I thought he was out of town.
  - He is.
  - Then don't hassle it.
- - Seen the new Playboy?
  - Naw. Any good?
  - Suzanne Somers' tits.
  - All right.
  - I like sex.
- - What the fuck is this guy doing?
  - This ain't no cop.
- - It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
  - They're fuckin' with us.
- - My brother's car!
  - All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
- - We just missed the turnoff to the party.
  - You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
- - My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me.
    He's gonna kill us.
  - Just be glad you're all right.
  - My brother is gonna shit.
  - Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
  - First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
  - Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman.
    He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
  - You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
- - That's him! He did it!
  - Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
- - How've you been?
  - Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
  - I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
  - I've been swimming, Merv.
- - Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash
    this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
  - I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
  - School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And
    if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
  - How often do you go?
  - I don't go at all.
- - I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
  - Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
- - Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
  - Fascinating.
- - Who's that?
  - That's me, Merv.
- - Are you going to ride that wave?
  - Totally.
- - What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
  - Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before
    these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
- - Are you Linda Barrett?
  - Yes.
  - I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could
    ask you something.
- - All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that
    you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One
    Plus Fifty's.
  - And they don't call my parents?
  - Not if you're over sixteen.
  - Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
  - And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
- - Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And
    I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
  - You should work for yourself.
- - You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
  - What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
  - It's definitely your mama.
  - Damone, you gotta listen to me.
- - All right... where did you see her?
  - She's in my biology class.
  - Did you get her number?
  - No.
  - Did you get her name?
  - No. It's too soon.
  - It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
  - Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class
    and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
  - I would. Yeah.
  - Really?
  - I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love
    with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never
    even talked to her.
  - You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
  - Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
- - Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything.
    This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that...
    girls do respond. Something happens.
  - Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you
    know something's gonna happen.
  - That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
  - The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays
    or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest
    and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
- - The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even
    listen to Aerosmith.
  - I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
  - There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come
    to the mall.
- - Hey, Rat.
  - Yeah?
  - Ace the jacket.
- - Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
  - What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give
    it to you for free.
- - Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
  - All right. Pay attention.
- - And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
  - I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started?
    I mean, I hardly know her.
  - You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how
    it starts...
- - Yo.
  - Damone. It's Mark.
  - Mark. What happened to your date?
  - It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except...
    I left my wallet at home.
  - Did you go home and get it?
  - No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask
    you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or
    any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet,
    and meet me back here?
- - Damone, are you there?
  - I'm really pretty busy...
- - Hey, Mark. Is that you?
  - Damone! You come here?
  - I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet
    the other day. You want it back?
  - Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton?
    Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
- - Well, I've gotta be running.
  - Okay. See ya.
- - Poor guy.
  - Really.
- - No. I don't think so. Not right now.
  - Chicken!
- - If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
  - No Damone. I don't understand.
  - She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
  - Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with
    Stacy. What have you got to prove?
  - Jesus. I'm sorry.
  - I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth'
    -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone
    says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know
    him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just
    finding out.
  - Fine. Get lost.
- - You're losing it, Damone.
  - You're crazy. Those girls love me.
- - The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
  - Whatever you say, Rat.
- - And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
  - Sensitive -- what is that?
  - Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
  - So what makes you so sensitive?
  - Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to
    feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
  - What do you read? What's the last book you read?
  - Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
  - Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
  - It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that
    girls do respond.
- - Nice to meet you, Stacy.
  - Nice to meet you.
- - Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
  - Oh, really?
- - Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
  - O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets
    home. Okay?
- - I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
  - Get a ride with somebody.
  - Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings,
    and then drives to school himself.
  - What a guy.
- - You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
  - Mark is a really nice boy...
- - Do you have any ice tea?
  - Sure. Come on in.
- - I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
  - I don't know.
  - Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
  - I know what I look like.
- - Do you want to take a quick swim?
  - Well...
  - Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
- - Pick a suit.
  - I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
- - Are you really a virgin?
  - Come on...
- - Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my
    friend.
  - He's my friend, too.
- - You're a really good kisser.
  - So are you.  Are you shaking?
  - No. Are you crazy?
- - Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
  - You first.
  - How about both of us at the same time?
- - I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
  - Let's continue.
- - Hey, Mike?
  - What? Are you all right?
  - I think we're making a lot of noise.
  - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- - What's wrong?
  - I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
  - I guess I did.
- - Oh. Hi.
  - I didn't see you this morning.
  - Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
  - I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
  - Hello.
- - What's going on?
  - Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
  - What? Now?
- - Why don't you call me up tonight?
  - Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
- - How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
  - I know it's yours.
- - Take that back.
  - All right, I take it back.
- - There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get
    an abortion.
  - We've got to get an abortion?
  - Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
  - It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
  - Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
  - Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
  - Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
- - Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
  - All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
  - Get going.
- - Dad says you have to get up!
  - Ugh.
- - Leave me alone!
  - Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
  - Leave me alone.
  - Dad says!
- - Jeff you have company!
  - Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
- - Any problems?
  - No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
- - Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
  - They were left over from the last shift.
  - Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
  - But they weren't mine.
- - Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
  - Okay, Dennis.
- - Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
  - He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
  - Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
  - Yes, sir.
  - You're fired.
- - Hi, Brad.
  - Sis.
- - Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am
    I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So
    who do you have first period?
  - U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
  - Hey-yo.
- - Mom says to clean up the pool.
  - Why can't you do it?
  - Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
  - Your friends use the pool too.
  - I take out the garbage.
  - Don't strain yourself.
- - Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
  - They're not home yet.
  - Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk
    of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
  - I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
  - I'll explain everything later.
- - Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
  - Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
  - It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
  - I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
- - Is everything okay at work?
  - Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad
    making me pay rent.
  - You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
  - I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful
    guy. I think I want my freedom.
  - Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
  - Where did you hear that?
  - I'm just guessing.
  - Well... it's true.
  - Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves
    Lisa.
  - Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her
    boyfriend.
- - Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
  - Why?
  - I don't know. I was just curious.
  - Maybe yes. Maybe no.
  - You are a virgin!
  - I didn't say that.
  - But your face did!
- - Are you still a virgin?
  - Maybe yes. Maybe no.
  - Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
- - Does Mom know you have company?
  - It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
- - Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
  - See you later.
  - Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
- - Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
  - Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
- - You're not going to tell me, are you?
  - No.
  - All right, then. It's your secret.
- - Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
  - No. I want my money back right now.
  - Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already,
    too...
  - See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the
    word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
- - I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
  - Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75
    back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
  - I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
  - I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
- - Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
  - Manager!!
- - Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
  - This is how I dress all the time.
  - But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
  - I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
- - Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and
    Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of
    our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
  - You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
  - Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
- - Something happened to them, mon.
  - Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
- - Go ahead. Just make it quick.
  - Totally.
  - It's the first door on your left.
- - I can't find it, mon!
  - It's the first door on your left!
  - On the ledge?
  - First door on your left!
  - There it is!
- - Easy, mon.
  - Later.
- - Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
  - Of course.
  - How much did they cost?
  - Don't worry about it.
- - What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two
    years, and...
  - Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
  - Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
  - I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
- - Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
  - If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
  - Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
- - I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
  - Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost
    out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be
    free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's
    the right thing.
- - Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
  - Arnold. What's happening?
- - Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the
    chicken, everything went downhill.
  - You want to work at Carl's?
  - Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to
    work with you guys.
  - I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
  - All right!!
- - '''Scuse me.'
  - I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.
    At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind
    your back...
  - If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
  - I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip
    away, and know it's never coming back.
- - Reed's gonna fix me up --
  - For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
  - Skeptical...?
- - It's just business.
  - I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
- - Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
  - I understand the business reasons.
  - Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about
    the past.
- - It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
  - Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments
    in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
  - Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
  - Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest
    step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four
    little words that can change our lives...
- - What are you doing?
  - Raising the shields.
  - You can't leave them out there.
- - What's going on?
  - Victor, are you feeling alright?
- - Victor, I'm sorry I --
  - Just find him.
- - Victor, your scar --
  - I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
  - I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
  - Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.
    You'll have round-the clock care.
- - You said it was urgent.
  - It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
- - Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've
    done for me, but I just don't --
  - Susan. What are you doing?
- - He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before
    --
  - Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
- - If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
  - Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under
    glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because
    you're his science project.
- - Please don't make this personal --
  - Oh, I think you already have.
  - Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
- - But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist.
    Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
  - You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about
    to explain...
- - This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
  - Not at all.
- - You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications
    or --
  - The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
- - Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
  - Hilarious.
- - Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
  - Sure.
- - We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the
    radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
  - Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little
    glitch. Just close the shields...
  - Ben's still out there --
  - So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
- - Come on, Ben, come on...
  - Reed, we're running out of time.
- - Not until Ben is back inside!
  - It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
- - Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
  - Ben did this.
  - Ben did this?
  - He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the
    only one.
- - I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened
    to you?
  - Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
- - Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people
    --
  - I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
  - Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I
    will not let you make me look like a fool --
  - Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
  - I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just
    want to fix it. Fast!
- - What are you doing here?
  - What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This
    all belongs to me.
- - But I'm not done with the machine --
  - Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could
    have mass-produced this by now.
- - You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
  - Never better.
- - Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
  - I was talking about us. Working together.
- - Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus
    on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the
    microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
  - Right. That's exactly what I meant.
- - I, uh, think I remember the number.
  - It's been changed.
- - As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
  - Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.
    You remember my brother Johnny...
- - Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a
    formula for this.
  - Great minds think alike.
- - Feeling better?
  - Yes, thanks.
  - That's good. That's uh... good.
  - You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
- - You're happy for me and Victor.
  - I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
  - Which was?
  - Passion.
- - For science.
  - You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained
    to you in quantum physics.
- - Uh, Sue...? I can't.
  - What? What do you mean you --
  - Sue... look at your hands.
- - It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
  - Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making
    that leap.
- - What?
  - We need to get past them.
- - Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
  - What...?  Oh.
- - How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
  - That's what we're here to find out.
  - If it happened to him, then it could...
- - It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some
    kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
  - What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side
    of the microscope?
- - You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could
    control your emotional state better --
  - Excuse me?
- - I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.
    Can you remember the exact emotions when --
  - Anger. Rage. Frustration.
  - Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
  - I'm sure I can come up with something.
- - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some
    kind of latent hostility or --
  - What in the world would give me that idea?
- - I mean, you broke up with me, right?
  - Are you kidding?
  - 'No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...'
- - Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
  - I think it was a little more complicated than --
  - I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
- - There were a lot of variables to consider --
  - No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually
    the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always
    does.
- - What are you doing?
  - The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount
    of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
- - If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity
    --
  - And reverse the mutations --
  - Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
- - But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
  - Of course. Of course.
  - And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
  - With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
- - Reed. How close are we to a cure?
  - No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
- - Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
  - He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
  - Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We
    are.
- - Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
  - Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head
    like --
  - I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around
    in there.
- - I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage
    --
  - Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
- - Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
  - You were?
  - Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times
    just so I'd have something to say to you.
- - You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
  - I gave him twenty.
- - You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...
    speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
  - I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
- - When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you
    to come find me.
  - Why didn't you say something?
  - That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
- - I can... make it work.
  - Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
  - The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
  - You need a doctor.
- - Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
  - I'm sure I can come up with something.
- - I found a broken gasket, from space --
  - A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
- - If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
  - And if he's not...?
  - Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
- - They're ready for you, sir.
  - Showtime.
- - Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.
    The bank's five times oversubscribed --
  - It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
  - Then what is it?
  - History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other
    matter?
- - Leonard, how's the feed?
  - Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
- - How's the IPO?
  - Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout
    from --
  - Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
  - Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
- - Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something
    about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
  - Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
  - And that's a good thing?
- - You know, maybe you should get some rest --
  - Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
- - Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but
    --
  - That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked
    Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
- - Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this
    to hit the press.
  - Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the
    Journal --
  - Front page?
  - Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
- - The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
  - Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
- - Apparently I can disappear.
  - Please tell me you go silent too.
- - Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
  - Johnny.
- - Stop it.
  - Okay, "mom."
- - What is that thing?
  - I think that thing is Ben.
- - Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
  - Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
  - Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
- - You're really cramping my style here.
  - You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
  - Sweet.
  - That's the temperature of the sun.
- - Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
  - Girl...?!
- - I'm driving.
  - Dude. That's my sister.
- - You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
  - You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
- - You two need a time-out.
  - Blockhead started it!
- - Johnny? Did you see Ben?
  - Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back
    to the real world.
  - Is that what you call it? "Real"?
  - At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
- - Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
  - Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your
    little boy --
  - As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think
    those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
- - I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
  - No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
- - What are you doing --
  - Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
  - But Johnny... you can't fly.
- - Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
  - What about you?
- - He's not responsive --
  - Ben! Ben!
- - Now what is up with that?
  - The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
  - Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
- - Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
  - Ben, are you there?
- - This is wrong in so many ways.
  - You've been working out.
- - Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
  - 'What he''s trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...'
- - Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
  - Oh, it is.
- - We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
  - This place is deluxe. You got cable?
  - '...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.'
- - Back it down, Johnny!
  - I can go hotter!
- - Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere
    and destroy all human life as we know it.
  - Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
- - Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
  - What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
  - What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
  - 'Oh, well that''s easy: I''m hot. You''re... well, you''re a little limp. Sue''s
    easy to see through. And Ben''s always been a hardass.  Why aren''t you writing
    this down?'
- - He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on
    it --
  - They're not costumes.
- - That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon.
    I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure
    and redistribute my density to --
  - Right, whatever, have fun.
- - You need to control yourself and think before you --
  - Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if
    we have some, you know... like, calling?
  - A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
- - Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
  - But all these people...
  - Now.
- - And where do we think we're going?
  - I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are
    right outside that window --
- - You're hot!
  - So are you!
  - I mean, you feel a little feverish.
  - I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
  - My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
  - Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
- - Me like-y.
  - Stay right. Left is trouble.
  - I though we went over this.
  - Last one down springs for room service.
- - You're on fire!
  - Not this again --
  - 'No: You''re ON FIRE!'
- - Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every
    system is still functioning, somehow --
  - And they're changing into...
  - I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium
    or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
  - Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
  - At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
  - What do you mean "complete"?
  - I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.
    I'll notify the CDC and --
- - What?
  - The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
- - But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
  - That's terrible news...
- - What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those
    SMBs --
  - Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations
    past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
- - If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
  - Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
- - Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
  - '''Course not. Strictly business.'
  - Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
  - Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
  - 'Let''s see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the
    world''s dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it''s a toss-up.'
  - Put your tiny little mind at ease.
  - Don't you wander off, boy.
- - Where... where am I?
  - Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
  - Reed?... Sue?
  - They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
- - What's wrong with me?
  - I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons
    in the world, Ben. You had the best --
  - Give me a mirror...
- - They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
  - Give me the god damn mirror!
- - Hey! That's a prototype!
  - Go back to the drawing board.
- - The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
  - Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
- - No more cracks about how I look.
  - Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
- - Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food,
    strip-mall science --
  - This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad.
    He's just a little...  Larger than life.
- - He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
  - You'd never know it.
- - I can't take this.
  - Ben. This is business. Just work.
- - What about his first born?
  - Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
- - He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
  - Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
  - Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you
    round --
  - We got what we wanted. That's enough.
  - I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
- - Can't do it. I cannot do it.
  - External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in
    --
  - No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of
    NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
  - Youthful high spirits.
- - They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
  - I'm sure he's matured since then.
- - When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
  - Five times.
  - I had it at four.
  - This makes five.
- - Isn't that your speech?
  - He's made a few changes.
  - This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
  - Victor's better at these things.
- - The shields on the station should protect us.
  - Should?
- - I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
  - Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
- - How long was I out?
  - Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
  - Solid.
- - I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
  - Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
  - I should have done more, run more tests --
- - You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman
    in your life.
  - Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
  - Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
- - What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
  - I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
  - He's smart, powerful, successful --
  - Well maybe you should date him.
- - Are you alright?
  - I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
- - What the --!
  - Ben. Are you okay?
  - Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
- - We had a tough year.
  - Yeah, nine years straight.
- - You got a chisel round here?
  - If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your
    recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
- - Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better
    coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
  - Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
  - Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
  - Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
  - O-kay. We'll skip that question.
- - It's about to be a broken face.
  - This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
- - Ben --
  - Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with
    every breath in your body?
  - We're working as hard as we can --
  - Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
- - Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
  - Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you
    to be patient for a little while longe--
- - 'Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...'
  - Got it, teach.
- - Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework
    the power settings...
  - Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
- - I'll be watching over you.
  - Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
- - Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
  - I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece,
    or you can forget being Best Man.
- - Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
  - Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
- - Ben?
  - Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember
    when we said "together forever no matter what"?
  - Baby, you're scaring me.
- - Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
  - Deb, it's me. It's still me.
- - What did you wish for, honey?
  - I already got it. Everything I want.
- - What are you doing here?
  - I'm worried about you.
  - About me? How sweet.
  - Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
- - Ben, come in.
  - What is this? Where's Reed?
  - Where do you think? With Sue.
- - What do you want, Vic?
  - 'To help you. I''ve run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result:
    the machine is ready.'
- - Reed said it'd be weeks till --
  - He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
- - He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet
    another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
  - And you can? Power it up?
- - Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
  - I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
- - I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know
    if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with
    them?
  - Victor did.
- - We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
  - Is it safe?
- - I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
  - Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
- - We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
  - Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
- - You look like an eighties rock band.
  - The suit will stretch. You should try it --
  - I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- - He didn't.
  - Oh, he did.
  - What did he do to the uniform?!
- - He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
  - It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
  - Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little
    step before he takes one --
  - It's easy for you to be patient.
  - No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together
    now, Ben.
- - Where is Reed?
  - Victor must've taken him.
- - You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
  - '"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."'
  - This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
- - You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus
    freak. People staring, whispering --
  - I wouldn't know anything about that.
  - I mean...
  - Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You
    went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
- - I don't think She's real big on hate.
  - You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
- - Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
  - Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
- - How'd you know it was me?
  - I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
- - I'm not really dressed for a party.
  - Relax, it's casual.
  - No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
- - Those yours too?
  - My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
- - We're going to have to work on your touch.
  - I like the sound of that.
- - Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it.
    The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional
    gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe
    to another, light years away.
  - How?
  - Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam
    of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics
    until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
- - A straight line.
  - Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
- - The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably.
    Nothing serious.
  - Do they have pressure?
  - Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units
    are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were
    in stasis.
- - Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect
    the scan?
  - If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over
    the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
- - What is it?
  - Ship's log.
- - What is it?
  - I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
- - 'That''s how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole''s immense
    gravitational power to create the gateway. That''s how the Event Horizon travels
    faster than light.'
  - I can't believe we built this.
- - Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
  - Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her.
    I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
  - Claire is your wife?
  - Yes.
  - It must be hard, being so far away from her.
  - Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
  - I'm sorry.
- - Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
  - No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just...
    stopped for seven years.
- - What are you doing?
  - It wants me. I have to go.
- - In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
  - I'm alright. Please.
- - What is it?
  - The forward airlock.
  - Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
- - Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
  - It means nothing.
- - I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now
    this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
  - Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll
    be on our own.
- - 30 hours to Neptune orbit.
  - All boards are green, everything's five by five.
- - You can't do that.
  - The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
- - This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon,
    Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...
  - Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper,
    I got a bad feeling about this...
- - If they are, they're screening their calls.
  - Range 3000 meters and closing.
- - The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
  - 1000 meters...
- - Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
  - Picking up magnetic interference.
- - What happened to his eyes?
  - Explosive decompression.
  - Decompression wouldn't do that.
- - Miller, do you read me, Peters --
  - Get them back --
  - I'm trying, goddammit --
- - What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
  - I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
- - Hey...
  - 'Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to
    "point B," here.  Now: what''s the shortest distance between two points?'
- - Where is she?
  - Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
- - Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
  - She's not ugly.
- - Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what
    have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment
    area. Can we move in closer?
  - Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
- - What the hell is that?
  - 'That''s the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.'
- - The safety circuit's failed!
  - We're losing atmosphere...
- - What?
  - It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
- - I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
  - Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
  - Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
- - There's no one in the corridor but us.
  - Not according to the computer.
- - He's engaged the override.
  - Can you shut it down?
- - Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
  - Keep him talking.
  - Do you know what it was?
- - Almost got it.
  - Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
- - We have to do something, oh God...
  - Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
- - You got any coffee?
  - It's cold.
  - I don't care.
- - First time in a grav couch?
  - Yes.
- - Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out
    with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer
    Reach.
  - He's been past Mars?
  - He served on the Goliath.
  - Wasn't that ship destroyed?
  - They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two
    tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was
    a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made
    it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
- - Claire...
  - DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
- - Here's another one. They're all over the place.
  - They're explosive charges.
- - Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
  - You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
- - Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
  - Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
  - Can you see a body?
  - There's no one here.
- - No. I saw nothing.
  - I did.
- - About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination
    tables and his legs were...
  - Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
  - I've seen bodies before. This is different.
- - We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
  - Justin?
- - Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
  - Let's go.
- - Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
  - I just finished drying...
  - Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some
    pants on.
- - Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
  - Come around to three-three-four...
- - Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
  - Radiation interference?
  - There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life
    forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
- - That's an affirmative.
  - Keep your eyes open.
- - Everybody okay?
  - We're all here.
  - Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
- - It tastes bad.
  - But you can breathe it.
- - The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain...
    No one's going to be coming to help us.
  - How much oh-two do we have?
  - Oxygen is not the problem.
  - Carbon dioxide?
  - It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon
    are shot.
  - We can take the filters from the Clark...
  - I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable
    air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
  - What about the life readings you picked up?
  - 'The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate
    origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right
    off the scale, but now it''s back to its previous levels.'
  - What's causing the readings?
  - I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
  - So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and
    all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
- - What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
  - Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead,
    I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
  - I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
  - Do it. Dr. Weir...
- - Maybe one of the original crew?
  - No. It was someone else.
  - Who?
  - Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
- - Miller...
  - What is it, Starck?
  - '...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings
    of indeterminate origin...'
  - '"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don''t you have anything useful to
    tell me?'
  - I've got a theory.
- - Go ahead.
  - There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what
    you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged.
    What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination,
    all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
- - You've got to listen...
  - To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
  - I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you,
    the ship is reacting to us...
  - We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
- - It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
  - Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
  - I know that.
- - If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
  - I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
- - What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
  - Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
  - I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you
    just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
- - Miller, come in...
  - What's going on in there, Starck?
  - Justin's in the airlock.
- - What?
  - He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
  - Stay here! Don't stop working!
- - I'm on my way, Starck.
  - You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
- - Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
  - Five seconds.
- - Weir can't be alive.
  - Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
- - Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
  - We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
- - BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
  - Blow it up?
  - We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest
    of the ship. We stay put...
- - I'll do it --
  - No. I'll be right back.
- - We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
  - '...repeat, we''re armed...'
  - Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
- - Weir.
  - He's dead...
- - 'I don''t like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the
    course locked in?'
  - Locked and cocked.
- - Jesus...
  - What is that?
- - Heading three-three-four...
  - '...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...'
  - One-four degrees...
- - We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere,
    we're in for some chop.
  - Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
- - We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
  - That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong,
    it goes against everything we know...
  - What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given
    us wings?"
  - Something like that, yeah.
- - I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
  - Yes, sir.
  - Dr. Weir...!
- - We've got some weather.
  - I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
- - 1500 meters. We're getting too close...
  - Where is it?
- - Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna
    hit!
  - Starck...
- - Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
  - Love to.
- - It is now.  We're locked in.
  - Starck, give me a read.
- - Captain Miller...
  - Smith, where the hell have you been?!
  - We have a situation here...
- - Do we have enough time for a weld?
  - We don't have time to fart.
  - We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked.
    In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
  - No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
  - They're gone.
- - But...
  - You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
- - Captain Miller, you copy?
  - I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
  - I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair
    it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
  - We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
  - Understood.
- - '...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won''t be a price? You
    already killed the first crew...'
  - That's enough!
- - Sir.
  - Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
- - Thank you.
  - Captain, we got a problem.
  - Now what?
  - She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
  - Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
- - Skipper...
  - What is it, Smith?
  - I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
- - Smith, get out of there...
  - Come again, Skipper?
  - One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put
    it on the Clark.
- - Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
  - No, no, we just got her back together...
  - Get out of there now!
- - Where is it, where is it...
  - Smith? Smith! Fuck!
- - Captain Miller, I just want to say...
  - The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll
    show you to the gravity tanks.
- - Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
  - Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were
    pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and
    no one's even told us why.
  - I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
  - Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
- - It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to
    safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the
    gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no
    enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until
    now.
  - Where has it been for the last seven years?
  - That's what we're here to find out.
- - What does it say?
  - NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
- - That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock
    there.
  - Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
  - Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
- - Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
  - Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
  - Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
  - That is not acceptable --
  - -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us
    from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
- - You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
  - Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging,
    not on this one, alright?
- - I can see that, what're they for?
  - In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section
    and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the
    gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
- - Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
  - Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
- - Any survivors?
  - Negative.
- - No one?
  - They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
- - It beats dying, Mister Smith.
  - Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
- - Yes.
  - One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
- - Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
  - It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting
    space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
  - What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
  - It's complicated...
  - 'How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now:
    what is in the Core?'
- - It's insane.
  - '"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take
    the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon
    could be there in a day...'
  - If it worked.
  - If it worked, yes.
- - I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
  - There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's
    under control.
  - Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No
    one goes near that thing.
- - You have something, Dr. Weir?
  - The date.
  - What about it?
  - The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
  - It's 2041...
  - Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
- - Explanation?
  - Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black
    holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The
    Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned
    from the dead.
- - What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
  - I don't know.
- - We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain,
    we're not gonna make it.
  - The Core...!
- - We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
  - Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
- - We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse.
    If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
  - I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent
    another power drain.
  - Do it.
- - Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't
    know."
  - Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
- - I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried
    to throw himself out of the airlock.
  - Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract
    very suddenly, causing reverberations --
  - That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard
    from you is bullshit!
  - What do you want me to say?
  - You said this ship creates a gateway...
  - Yes...
  - To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
  - I don't know...
  - Where has it been for the past seven years?
  - I don't know...
  - The "Other Place," what is that...?
  - I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't
    understand. Truth takes time.
  - That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
- - We're leaving.
  - You can't, your orders are specific...
  - '"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This
    ship killed them. And now it''s killing us.'
  - You're insane. You've lost your mind.
  - Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when
    I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck,
    download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish
    moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
  - Don't... don't do this...
  - It's done.
- - What about my ship?
  - We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles
    at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this
    ship.
  - You... You can't do that!
  - Watch me.
- - You can't leave. She won't let you.
  - Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself
    looking for a ride home.
- - I told you... She won't let you leave...
  - Son of a bitch!
- - Your eyes...
  - I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
  - What are you talking about?
  - Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a
    black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything,
    then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
- - If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
  - What makes you think I'll miss?
- - Weir is dead.
  - Then who the fuck are you?
  - Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
- - What are you?
  - You know.
  - You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
  - I'm not the Devil.
  - Then what, what are you? Tell me...
  - Better if I just show you.
- - There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
  - You're lying...!
  - I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your
    crew. You're all coming with me.
  - Starck... Cooper...
- - You can't have them. Go to hell.
  - NOOO!
- - What's the hold up?
  - Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
  - I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
  - No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll
    get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
  - I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
- - We've got pressure.
  - Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
- - Jesus its huge.
  - Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
- - That means they didn't abandon ship.
  - So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
- - Peters is right, no one's here.
  - I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
- - I can see the hatch.
  - Starck, you still showing those readings?
- - The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
  - There's no one here, Skipper.
- - Okay. I'm on the bridge.
  - What you got, Peters?
- - Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull,
    it's intact.
  - The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
- - I found one.
  - Alive?
  - Frozen.
- - Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
  - '...how''s the client?'
  - Crystallized.
- - Can anybody hear me...
  - Skipper...
  - Peters...
  - '...you okay?'
  - Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
- - Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
  - I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
  - Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
- - I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
  - Do it.
- - That's a negative, Starck.
  - Justin.
- - Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
  - I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
  - Thanks.
- - This is Weir.
  - Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
- - Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
  - I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating
    the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team
    out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending
    an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
  - I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't
    factor into this.
  - 'This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon
    was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring
    new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn''t just lose
    the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.'
- - Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon,
    every two minutes.
  - The crew? Could they still be alive?
  - The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven
    years.
  - Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
- - Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
  - Start the countdown.
- - Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus.
    I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
  - Yes, sir!
- - Justin, finish your sweep.
  - Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
- - Patch me through to him.
  - Justin.
  - Skipper, you gotta help me...
- - '...I don''t want to die...!'
  - You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm
    gonna get you out of there, alright?
  - But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
  - Justin. I won't let you die.
- - '...is zero. That''s what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point
    A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through
    this gateway, space returns to normal.  It''s called a gravity drive.'
  - How do you know all this?
  - I built it.
- - You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other
    side.
  - We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
  - Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
- - I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
  - That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
  - I'm going in.
- - What, Justin, what shows you?
  - It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
  - What does?
  - The dark inside me.
- - '...It''s inside and it eats and eats until there''s nothing left.'
  - '"The dark inside..."? I don''t understand.'
  - From the Other Place...
- - Oh my god OH MY GOD...
  - Starck!
- - It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
  - Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
- - You're not seriously considering sending him?
  - You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton.
    If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest
    mind in physics since Einstein.
  - The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
  - That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit
    the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
  - Does he know that?
  - What's on your mind?
  - He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's
    too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
  - It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
  - Some things you don't get over.
- - I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
  - The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked
    in bay four.
- - You wanted to see me, Admiral?
  - I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires
    your immediate attention. Lyle?
- - Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this,
    this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
  - I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
  - It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
- - That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into
    New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send
    out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it
    really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare
    a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
  - A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this.
    I have to go with them.
- - It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll
    know my decision by the end of the day.
  - Thank you.
  - Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
- - What's wrong?
  - Nothing. It's nothing.
- - What's happening...?
  - A power drain --
- - What's wrong?
  - You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
- - I've got a pulse, he's alive...
  - Pressure?
  - 90 over 50 and falling... .
  - He's crashing...
- - Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
  - His peritoneum has ruptured...
  - One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen,
    Christ, he's bleeding out...
- - He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
  - Trauma.
  - And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going.
    Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
- - We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
  - No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or
    not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
- - How is he?
  - His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen
    minutes. He might not wake up at all.
- - Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
  - Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then
    he disappeared.
- - To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can
    should get some sleep.
  - I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
- - He'll live... if we ever make it back.
  - We'll make it.
- - Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just
    one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today.
    Real close.
  - '"Another man?" Who?'
- - I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time.
    The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides
    over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then
    he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows
    about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what
    we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
  - No.
- - What is it?
  - I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in
    the translation.
  - Go on.
- - They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:"
    "Save yourself."
  - It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
  - It gets worse.
- - Do you hear it? Right there.
  - Hear what?
  - It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi."
    "Hell."
  - '"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship
    is possessed?'
  - No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship
    has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where
    this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
- - DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
  - What happened?
  - Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
- - Please...
  - Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
  - Please... kill...
  - Oh God...
- - Is that an offer?
  - It is not.
- - What's happening?
  - I don't know, the screens are dead...!
- - Let me breathe, let me breathe...
  - You're okay now, it's over...
- - How? The Bridge is gone.
  - There must be a way! What about Engineering?
  - Can you shut it down?
  - I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
  - I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
- - I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
  - Hurry.
- - What...?
  - Run!
- - Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
  - What?
  - Coffee.
  - No, thank you.
- - The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible,
    but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to
    endure until now.
  - Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
- - It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became
    metal...
  - No, he didn't.
  - You weren't there. I saw it.
  - Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing
    is not physically possible...
- - I don't know what happened to Justin.
  - I'm telling you, I saw it...
  - What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
  - I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
- - You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
  - I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this
    can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
  - What?
  - 'You heard me. This ship, it''s crazy: trying to go faster''n light, that''s like
    the Tower of Babel.'
  - Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
  - You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
  - You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
- - We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
  - What about the accumulator...?
- - It's holding... She's holding...!
  - We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
- - Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
  - Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
  - Roger that.
- - Time to play Spam in the can.
  - Don't start with me, Cooper.
- - 'Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr.
    Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship''s engineer --'
  - You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
  - This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
- - '...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!'
  - EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
- - From what?
  - You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
- - '...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...'
  - You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything
    happens...
  - I'll be all over it.
- - We have a man down...
  - Coop, where are you...
  - The containment, Second Containment...
  - Hold on, Coop...
- - But Justin...
  - I'll get him.
- - Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
  - On my way.
- - '...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.'
  - You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
  - Will it work?
  - It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
- - Ballast.
  - I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
- - That means top-secret, Cooper.
  - I heard it.
- - I can see why they sent you along.
  - So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
- - You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya
    veins.
  - I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step
    aside, old man.
- - '...do you copy?'
  - Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
  - Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
  - I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have
    been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
- - Holy shit...
  - Justin?
  - I think I found something...
- - To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying,
    eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise
    for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In
    some circles that's half a year. How are you?
  - Tired...
  - That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard
    you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
  - A born freak can only go uphill.
  - Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a
    male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi
    and you'll see what I mean.
  - I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have
    been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven
    years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as
    I used to be.
  - Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful
    than ever.
  - Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
- - You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through
    nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony
    has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew.
    I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they
    start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms,
    like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party.
    They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
  - Bonanza Jellybean?
  - What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
- - She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something
    wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve
    to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
  - Your ranch?
  - Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women
    of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal
    products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
- - Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten
    highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
  - A job for me?
  - I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni
    Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
- - The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause
    such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges
    that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products
    from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
  - Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What
    do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out
    West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and
    tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees
    and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair
    styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named
    the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless
    its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this.
    It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild
    whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond
    -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few
    days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never
    seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I
    mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips
    on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes,
    in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest
    show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular
    with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full
    dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings,
    strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing
    their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate
    sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw
    in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves
    trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she
    dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a
    can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice
    is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get
    it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness
    gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it.
    I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers
    around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better,
    not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out
    of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're
    back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the
    watercolorist.
- - If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
  - Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
  - But Countess...
  - 'Now, now. Don''t get exasperated. I realize that you''ve always avoided all but
    the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you''ve been wise.
    Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is
    a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy,
    offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn''t have to
    dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to
    go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But
    for a woman marriage is surrender.'
- - But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
  - Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid
    of me, I think...
  - Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically
    impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know.
    Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit,
    that's all.
  - What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
  - I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
  - Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for
    you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City.
    However...
  - Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
- - Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The
    cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly
    well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is
    between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And
    who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something
    so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How
    much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered
    my moo cows?
  - I don't know anything about it.
  - Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience
    be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts
    are going to suffer...
- - Going north?
  - You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
- - Thanks.
  - American Cheese. The king of road food.
- - Are you in show business?
  - I was a successful model once.
  - For magazines?
  - I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
  - So now you're bummin' around?
  - Yep.
  - Hitchhiking?
  - I'm the best.
  - You're the best?
  - When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping,
    without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs
    in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
  - Whooee!
  - 'As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of
    style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in
    something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving,
    stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately
    that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I
    embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.'
- - I'm cold.
  - Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
  - It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not
    even your birds.
- - What are you doing?
  - Getting dressed. I've got to go.
  - But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner.
    And tonight... we can... really make love.
  - I have to go, Julian.
  - Why? Why do you have to go?
  - My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised.
    I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician
    practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get
    stiff and sore.
- - Extraordinary!
  - She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or
    one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
  - Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess,
    but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way
    she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
  - It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the
    best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
  - Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
  - Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
  - I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got
    some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though;
    but.... then she left town.
  - She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed?
    How does she like it in bed?
- - How does she like what in bed?
  - Like what?
- - What do you think?
  - Well.... er...
  - Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
  - Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
  - Whose fault was that?
  - I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
  - What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down
    and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out
    of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all
    he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat
    in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton
    could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate
    for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
  - If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't
    go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll
    be calling me 'chief.'
  - Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
  - What guy?
  - Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch
    the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll
    bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven.
    Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
- - Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took
    so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days
    -- and a heap of planning to do.
  - Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
  - Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself.
    Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you
    once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about
    you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh,
    your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl
    friend...
- - No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down.
    We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover.
    Besides, I always travel alone.
  - Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks
    were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope,
    clichs and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to
    be a cowgirl.
- - Tell me about it.
  - About...
  - About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it
    sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
  - 'Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially
    for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence
    of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they''re being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall
    of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of ''em are
    trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos.
    Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That''s what
    prostitutes call it, you know: ''tricking.'''
- - You're political, then?
  - No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't
    share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people
    who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
- - Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not
    original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
  - Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What
    else have you learned from the Chink?
  - Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a
    lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
- - '......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third
    Vision hasn''t happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in
    touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple
    of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.'
  - What is Debbie's position?
  - Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine
    way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says
    it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples
    for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that
    Debbie-dear.
  - You don't agree with Debbie, then?
  - I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when
    it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight
    about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles,
    doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that
    fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any
    bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar.
    Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
- - That's Jellybean!
  - FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED
    THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD,
    FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
- - Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
  - So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually
    prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
  - Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes.
    I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue,
    then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that --
    for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
  - How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
- - No, I guess not.
  - '''Drugged'' is a stupid word.'
  - But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory
    pattern that goes back thousands of years.
- - Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
  - If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes
    your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers
    with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
- - Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
  - I'm staying with the Countess.
  - I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
  - I don't.
  - You don't?
  - Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
- - A traveler, eh?
  - You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
- - Where are the others?
  - Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
- - I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
  - I know who you are.
  - Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of
    the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could
    help...
  - Save your breath for the climb.
- - But I don't know how to polka.
  - Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
- - What was that?
  - Clockworks.
  - Clockworks?
- - The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation
    to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside
    confederate of the Clock People.
  - Siwash, huh?
  - He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that
    he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away
    Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
- - But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the
    ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
  - The Clock People?
- - During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American,
    I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who
    discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra
    Nevada mountains.
  - Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
  - The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that
    all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian
    sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me.
    The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians
    from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
- - What do you believe in then?
  - Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
- - Is everything getting worse?
  - Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
  - The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to
    all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week.
    And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors
    thought he was... here's a picture!
- - I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and
    wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
  - She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
  - You mean she's dead?
- - But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
  - Easy come, easy go.
- - Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world,
    drop us a postcard.
  - The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is
    going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime.
    The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may
    be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones
    are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human
    race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other
    words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned
    to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without
    the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our
    bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic
    philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing
    for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going
    to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets
    of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept
    my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine,
    nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield --
    that you couldn't survive in that cave.
- - Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash
    Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry,
    forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe
    of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not
    use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits
    and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual
    equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics
    living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps,
    and paying them the respect they deserve.
  - How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated
    ridgetop with Delores?
  - That's your problem.
- - The voltage looks fine.
  - Then check the connections.
- - Does that help?
  - Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
- - It's an apartment.
  - Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort
    of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
  - Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
  - Yeah.
- - Yeah?
  - Just wanted to let you know.
  - I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
  - She likes you okay.
  - I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
  - You can if you want.
  - Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
  - This one's history. Moving on...
  - The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
  - Patrick, we need to focus.
- - I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
  - She was unconscious, Patrick.
  - She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of
    her panties, is what.
  - Jesus, Patrick!
- - Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
  - Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
  - Okay, There's more, Stan --
- - What's your bartlett's?
  - It's a quote book.
- - Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend
    is very --
  - Patrick, we're in the middle of --
  - She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
- - I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
  - Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
- - Oh, hi.
  - Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
  - I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
  - Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
  - Of course. Please have a seat.
- - This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth.
    And only I know it.
  - Maybe after the holidays then.
- - Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
  - 'December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don''t know what to
    do. Her name is Clementine and she''s amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate
    and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.'
- - Mary. What are you doing here?
  - She came to help, Howard.
- - I tried that already.
  - Did you try going through C-Gate?
  - Yeah. Of course.
- - You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
  - Yeah, probably a good idea.
- - Howard, they've disappeared again.
  - Oh dear.
- - I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
  - That's fine, Stan.
- - So, I've got to drop the van off.
  - Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
- - She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
  - I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
  - Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
  - Jesus.
- - Stan? What's going on?
  - The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
  - Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
  - I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
  - Well, where was Patrick?
  - He went home sick.
  - Jesus. All right, what's the address.
  - 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
- - Howard, your one o'clock.
  - Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
- - Mary...
  - Yes?
  - Order me a pastrami for after?
  - Cole slaw, ice tea?
  - Thanks.
  - Welcome, Howard.
- - Okay, we're back in.
  - That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
  - Well, thank you, Mary.
- - Do you like quotes, Howard?
  - How do you mean?
  - Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my
    reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
  - Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
- - Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better
    even of their blunders."
  - Is that Nietzsche?
  - Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you
    didn't know.
  - It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
- - There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
  - Alexander Pope?
  - Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say
    Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched
    myself out.
  - It's no big deal.
  - You are such a sweetheart.
- - That's lovely.
  - Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work
    that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're
    outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
  - It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
  - Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
- - I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
  - I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
  - I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
- - We can't do this.
  - No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
- - What, Howard?
  - We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done...
    to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
- - Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
  - I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
  - Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe
    I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone
    else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't
    even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
  - I have a family, Mary.
  - You made me have an abortion.
  - It was a mutual decision.
  - You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
  - I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
- - Boo.
  - Hi.
- - Stan... c'mon...
  - Sorry. I just --
  - It's just... y'know... I mean...
  - I know. Anyway --
  - Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
- - See you later, alligator.
  - '''kay.'
  - Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
  - I better do this, Stan.
- - It's freezing out.
  - You found us okay?
  - Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
  - We haven't checked.
  - Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
- - Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
  - That's a good one.
  - Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
  - It's a good one all right.
- - Yup.
  - Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
  - Yup.
- - Let him go, Stan. I can help.
  - Go.
- - It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
  - Yeah.
  - To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh,
    so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias
    and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
  - You love him, don't you?
- - It's stopped.
  - What?
  - Listen, it's not erasing.
- - It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
  - Where?
  - I don't know. He's not on the map.
- - I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
  - Well, what should we do?
  - I don't know! I just said that!
  - Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
  - Shit!
- - No way. I can handle this.
  - This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
- - He's coming?
  - You better go.
  - Hell no.
- - Hey.
  - Do you swear you didn't know?
  - I swear.
  - And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
  - Once, maybe.
- - It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together.
    You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
  - How did I look?
  - Happy. Happy with a secret.
- - And after that?
  - I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
- - I really like you, Mary. You know that.
  - Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him?
    Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled?
    Tell me everything.
  - You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning
    against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed.
    I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked
    in love.
  - Thanks, Stan.
- - Oh.
  - Hi.
  - What do you want, Stan?
  - Can I... I brought some --
- - What's this?
  - Nothing.
  - I know what it is.
  - Then why did you ask me?
  - I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at
    the office.
  - They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember
    my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you
    understand that?
- - Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
  - I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
    What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
  - The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
  - Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
  - Mary... please. This is hurting people.
- - Oh, hey, Patrick.
  - Hi, Mary. How's it going?
- - Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
  - Nah, I don't know.
- - I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's
    about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
  - Yeah. Cool.
  - '"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."'
  - Very cool. Trippy.
  - I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
- - Definitely!
  - I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
- - Yours?
  - You take it. I don't know.
- - Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in
    touch.
  - Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
- - So what's going on, Joel?
  - I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
  - What?
  - Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
  - Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
  - I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one
    person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
  - Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
  - No. I just need some space, maybe.
  - The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the
    thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
  - It's not somebody else.
- - Hi.
  - Hi.
  - How was it?
  - You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
  - Hi, Rob and Carrie.
  - Go back to sleep.
- - Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
  - In a minute.
- - So you don't mind?
  - I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
- - Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
  - I hope you get your work done.
  - Yeah.
- - So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
  - It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
  - I'm sorry.
  - Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
  - Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted
    and --
  - I miss you.
  - Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
  - Oh! Great. That's great!
  - A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
  - I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
  - I'm glad you called.
- - So you think the dissertation will get published?
  - I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism
    and Misogyny.
- - Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
  - I had a good time last night. I really did.
  - So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
  - We'll speak soon.
  - '''Night.'
- - We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional
    core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation
    process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted
    will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
  - Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
  - Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night
    of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
- - I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
  - Well... I did.
  - We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything
    you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
  - It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
- - We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything
    you can remember about --
  - You have to stop this!
  - What? What do you mean?
  - I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
  - Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head,
    too.
- - It was snowing.
  - There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
- - The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
  - I'm like a joke to them.
- - I might be making a mistake.
  - Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First
    of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history
    are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't
    care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
  - Fuck you, Clementine.
- - Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through
    with this. I have no choice.
  - The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were
    they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't
    know what they are. I have no choice.
- - It's them.
  - It's too late.
- - I should maybe talk to you.
  - Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
- - I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain
    everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time
    together. You'll know everything again and...
  - Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and
    I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild
    and we could be happy again and...
- - Clementine.
  - That's your look for me.
- - Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what
    we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
  - Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going
    to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
- - So then she just stops calling.
  - I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
  - Any messages, Carmen?
- - Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
  - And what are you like? A wino?
- - How's the chicken?
  - Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
- - She's so sexy.
  - I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
- - I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
  - I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
- - Naomi.
  - On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost
    reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back,
    erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't
    happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and
    to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and
    the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real
    and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun.
    I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that
    no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit...
    then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this
    point in my argument, about dying.
- - Okay. I wish you could come.
  - This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
- - Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even
    hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
  - I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because
    she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
  - But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
    next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
- - So you're still on the Zoloft?
  - Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
- - Clementine.
  - I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
- - I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
  - I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you
    were exciting. You called from upstairs.
- - Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
  - Hi.
  - How's it going?
  - Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
  - I know. I had to take the day to think.
  - Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
  - I just got in.
  - Long day thinking.
- - That's me.
  - There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast
    without considering the problems we had...
- - What took you so long?
  - I just walked in.
  - Hmmm. Do you miss me?
  - Oddly enough, I do.
  - Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
  - I guess so.
  - Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
- - Yeah?
  - Did you send this? Is it a joke?
  - I probably got the same thing as you.
  - I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
  - Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
  - That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure
    like this. It's a joke.
- - It's true.
  - I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
- - Look, I have to go. I have to think.
  - Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet
    and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
- - Hi, it's Joel.
  - Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
  - I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
  - God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
  - You must have been crazy.
  - Guess what I'm wearing.
  - I don't know. Panties and --
  - Your dried cum.
  - Jesus.
- - I'm sorry.
  - Why?
  - Why what?
  - Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
  - No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
- - Really?
  - Well, I didn't want to assume.
  - Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you
    in an otherwise empty car.
  - Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
- - It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to
    scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to
    write or something.
  - No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
  - Oh. So...
- - I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
  - No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
  - It's okay, really.
  - Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How
    far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
  - Rockville Center.
  - Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
  - The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in
    the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
  - 'Ucch, really? You''re kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that''s me:
    book slave there for, like, five years now.'
  - Really? Because --
  - Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
  - -- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
  - Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a
    cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
  - I don't have one.
  - I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
  - I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty
    sure I recognized you.
  - Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
  - I like it.
  - Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
  - Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
  - Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
  - I can't remember.
  - Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red
    Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those
    names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
  - I don't really know how --
  - Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
  - You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there
    be?
  - Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there
    are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
  - I'm sure you would.
  - My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits
    album is Rain Dogs.
  - You sure? That doesn't sound --
  - I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too
    old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I
    apply my personality in a paste. You?
  - Oh, I doubt that's the case.
  - Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
  - Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
  - Yeah, I got it.
- - My name's Clementine, by the way.
  - I'm Joel.
  - No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
  - I don't know any jokes about your name.
  - Huckleberry Hound?
  - I don't know what that means.
  - Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
  - I'm not nuts.
  - Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
  - Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
  - Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
  - See, I wouldn't think that about you.
  - Why wouldn't you think that about me?
  - Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
  - Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty
    and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
  - Well, anyway... Sorry.
- - I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to
    be it at me.
  - Okay.
  - Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
- - Joel? It's Joel, right?
  - Yes?
  - I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm
    a little out of sorts today.
  - That's okay.
  - My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway.
    I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now
    I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
  - It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
  - Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
  - Probably see you at the book store.
  - Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
- - Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
  - No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
  - You're sure? It's cold.
  - I don't want to take you out of your way.
  - It's okay.
  - Yeah?
- - Where do you live?
  - You're not a stalker or anything, right?
  - Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
  - You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable.
    I don't need that.
  - I'm not a stalker.
  - You know Wilmont?
  - Yeah.
  - Wilmont. Near the high school.
- - Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
  - It's okay. I didn't think you were.
- - So you like bookstores, huh?
  - I like to read.
  - Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
  - Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
  - The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember.
    "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over
    the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
  - Sort of, um...
  - Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm
    lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your
    hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
  - What?
  - I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
- - Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
  - Well, I wouldn't want to be --
  - Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
- - Take care.
  - Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
  - Um --
  - Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
- - You like that?
  - Very much.
  - This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows.
    I think I used to be a crow.
- - Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
  - Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
  - I don't know.
  - Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down
    on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And
    saved some part/Of a day I rued.
  - Frost?
  - Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly
    grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is
    grade school. Y'know?
  - It's pretty.
  - I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden.
    When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds
    like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then.
    Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
  - Cheers.
- - God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
  - I'm fine.
  - Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
- - Ready for another?
  - No, I'm okay for now.
- - What do you want to hear?
  - You pick it.
  - You just say. I'm not really --
  - I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
- - Well, I should probably get going.
  - No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
  - No. I --
  - I know a man who needs a refill.
- - Thanks.
  - Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
- - Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
  - Yeah?
  - Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know.
    Do you believe in that stuff?
  - I don't know.
  - Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's
    just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you
    think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
  - Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
  - Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like,
    okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what
    you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
  - Yeah, I guess.
  - But I think I am. I like to think I am.
  - It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed,
    aren't you?
  - Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what
    to say.
  - Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living
    my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making
    sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
  - I think about that.
- - You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
  - I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
  - I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest
    psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it.
    But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
  - Thanks.
  - And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going
    on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
  - Yeah.
  - What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you
    know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come
    quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and
    I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone --
    that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's
    what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through.
    And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true,
    and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
  - Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
  - Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows
    what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
  - Yeah.
  - You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
  - No.
  - I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you
    think I'm repulsively fat?
  - No, not at all.
  - I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love
    my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the
    general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this
    guy...
- - Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's
    really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like,
    a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that
    just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
  - Oh, yeah.
  - That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to
    lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
  - That's scary sounding.
  - Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so
    I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice
    things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And
    that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
  - I think so.
  - I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things.
    We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's
    cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
  - Okay.
  - Yeah? Oh, great!
- - I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
  - Sounds good. But right now I should go.
  - You should stay.
  - I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
  - Okay.
- - I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
  - Yes.
- - So, I enjoyed meeting you.
  - You'll call me, right?
  - Yeah.
  - When?
  - Tomorrow?
  - Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
  - Okay.
- - How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
  - You didn't say anything about my hair.
- - Yo ho ho!
  - It's three.
- - I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
  - '...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don''t call me pathetic.'
  - Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
- - I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
  - Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old
    lady or something.
- - A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked
    out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're
    trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
  - No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people
    to like you?
- - Let me drive you home.
  - Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
  - Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
- - How can you watch this crap?
  - Where are you going?
  - I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
- - Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
  - I want to have a baby.
  - Let's talk about it later.
  - No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
  - I don't think we're ready.
  - You're not ready.
  - Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
- - What?!
  - I don't want to talk about this here.
  - Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
- - You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about
    it!
  - Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
  - I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd
    make a fucking good mother!
- - Oh, thank God. It's going.
  - It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you
    are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right
    here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out
    with!
- - So, um --
  - Would you get me another, Joely?
- - You're drunk.
  - You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
- - You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every
    damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
  - No, it isn't that.
  - I want to know you.
  - I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
  - Joel, you're a liar.
- - More?
  - No. Thanks.
- - Joely...
  - Yeah, Tangerine?
  - Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
  - No.
  - It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this
    part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't
    believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't
    often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be
    carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been
    loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.
    But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly,
    except to people who don't understand."
- - Such a beautiful view.
  - Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
  - Oh?
  - I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and
    don't know you anymore.
  - Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
  - I don't know.
- - What if you hide me?
  - What do you mean?
  - Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a
    memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
- - I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
  - I'm right here.
  - I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
  - Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
- - You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning.
    And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
  - I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought,
    how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
- - You remember what happened next?
  - I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly
    sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
  - -- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
- - There's this guy!
  - What?
  - There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser
    guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself
    the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
  - Really? Is he cute?
  - He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
  - Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked
    out now.
- - But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
  - Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
  - Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
- - They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
  - Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
- - Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
  - This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
- - Joel!
  - I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
- - Happy Birthday.
  - Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
- - I scoured the city for it.
  - I love it!
- - I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
  - Yeah.
  - I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
  - This is our first "date" date.
  - Do you remember what we talked about?
  - Naomi, I guess.
  - Yeah.
  - What was I wearing?
  - God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
  - Egad, were you horrified?
  - No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
- - Right. Something black though.
  - I'll buy that. Black's always good.
  - We did talk about Naomi.
  - 'I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.'
  - I'm sure, I said.
  - But you weren't. I could tell.
  - I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long
    silences.
- - 'I thought I was foolish. I thought I''d mistaken infatuation for love. You said:'
  - So what. Infatuation is good, too.
  - And I didn't have an argument.
- - I dropped you off after. You said --
  - Come up and see me... now.
  - It's very late.
  - Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
- - I told her today I need to end it.
  - Is that what you want?
  - I did it. I guess that means something.
- - I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated.
    You did run away, after all.
  - Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
  - Yeah?
  - I'd like to... take you out or something.
  - Well, you're married.
  - Not yet. Not married.
  - Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not
    going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If
    you want to be with me, you're with me.
  - Okay.
  - So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
- - Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys
    think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm
    just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me
    yours.
  - I remember that speech really well.
  - I had you pegged, didn't I?
  - You had the whole human race pegged.
  - Probably.
  - I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
  - I know.
  - It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
  - Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
- - Hi there.
  - Hi.
- - You said...
  - I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal,
    who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
  - Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
  - I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're
    uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I
    tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then
    I hate myself after for being such a clod.
  - Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to
    me if you couldn't talk to people?
- - You know what I did.
  - Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
  - You said --
- - I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
  - And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate
    like we were already lovers.
- - Oh God, how horrid.
  - I'm Joel.
- - You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine...
    ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
  - Yeah, like that.
  - Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
    I think your name is magic.
- - This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
  - I know.
  - What do we do?
  - Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
- - No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
  - I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
  - But my sleeping is really fucked up.
  - I don't think I've slept in a year.
  - You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it
    works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
  - yeah?
  - I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
  - Okay.
  - Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
  - I love her.
  - Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a
    book store.
  - I think she's great.
  - Me too. There's this poem --
  - Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
  - I think, before.
  - Seems too coincidental that way.
  - Yeah, maybe.
- - Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which
    we don't live...
  - Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send
    all these lines"?
  - Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look,
    houses in which we don't live.
- - I wish we did. You married?
  - Um, no.
  - Let's move into this neighborhood.
- - I do sort of live with somebody though.
  - Oh.
- - Male or female?
  - Female.
  - At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
- - Cool.
  - What are you doing?
  - It's freezing out here.
- - C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place
    is closed up. Electricity's off.
  - I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
  - I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
- - I knew.
  - I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
    criminally trespass.
  - It's dark.
  - Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
  - Naomi.
- - Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
  - I think we should go.
  - No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one
    do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks.
    I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at
    the moment.
- - So go.
  - I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought
    you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.
    You said, "so go" with such disdain.
  - What if you stay this time?
  - I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
  - Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
- - Bye, Joel.
  - I love you.
- - So you'll call me, right?
  - Yeah.
  - When?
  - Tomorrow?
  - Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
  - Yeah.
- - Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
  - I don't know.
- - I don't know. What if it breaks?
  - What if?
- - I think I should go back.
  - Joel, come here. Please.
- - Listen, did you want to make love?
  - Make love?
  - Have sex. Y'know --
  - Oh, um...
  - Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right
    now.
  - That's okay. I --
  - I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic
    place to do it and --
  - Hey, Joel --
  - -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
  - I'm nervous, too.
  - Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
  - Well, you obviously don't know me.
  - I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
- - Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
  - Says you were a bully...
  - A bully? Moi?
  - That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and
    timid.
  - Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
  - Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual
    conquests.
  - Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
  - I don't know.
  - Doesn't sound like me.
  - Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
  - Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married
    couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
  - I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough
    to be erotic.
  - We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
- - You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it
    as my "gratuitous need to shock."
  - I can't stop thinking about you.
  - Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
  - What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
  - I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
- - How are you today?
  - Okay, I guess.
  - Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
- - Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
  - You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
  - What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
- - Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever
    the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain
    level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant
    questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not
    happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The
    thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have
    a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle --
    which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really
    settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have
    some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think,
    no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out
    and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and...
    It's complicated. Y'know?
  - I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your
    relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about
    you. And we'll take it from there.
- - I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
  - You were not.
  - I was not.
- - Come over after I'm done here?
  - I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
  - You rat.
  - I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
- - It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
  - In the room?
  - In the world.
- - Oh, baby, what's going on?
  - I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting
    old and nothing makes any sense to me.
  - Oh, Tangerine.
  - Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
- - Come up to Boston with me?
  - Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
  - Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
  - Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
  - Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
- - I'm so excited. Yay!
  - I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
- - I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
  - It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me
    a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
- - What's wrong with me?
  - Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
- - May I help you?
  - Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
  - Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
- - Ms. Kruczynski?
  - Hi.
- - How are you today?
  - Okay, I guess.
  - Here we are.
- - Shit. The last time I saw you.
  - Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
- - But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough
    to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
  - But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people
    do well at this stuff?
  - And I just liked you so much.
  - You did? You liked me?
- - No, it was lovely.
  - Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
- - I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
  - She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
- - Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
  - I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
- - You weren't supposed to see that.
  - They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
  - Sweetie, we called the company.
- - Thanks, guys.
  - I hope you feel better, sweetie.
  - Yeah.
  - Say hi to Naomi.
- - I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
  - Just a little overworked, maybe.
- - I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit --
    I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi
    and me.
  - I did. You said, things were fine.
  - I remember.
  - This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down
    the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
  - Yeah, you told me that later.
  - I told you that later.
- - Who was the girl you walked off with?
  - No one.
- - And you've got BOTH axes?
  - Yes, Mother.
  - And something to sharpen them with?
  - Yes, Mum.
  - 'And don''t forget: never let your enemy get behind you.'
  - No, Mother.
  - And keep your sword greased.
  - Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
- - And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
  - I never do...
- - He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
  - You liar!
- - Well I'M certainly not, either.
  - Neither am I.
- - Well... I'm game.
  - Me too.
- - Shut up.
  - Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
- - Thorfinn! You can't die!
  - I'm not frightened... of anything...
  - You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
  - No... he's not... not... there...
  - Tell him I'm coming!
- - It's a tradition.
  - I know, Dad.
  - I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
  - You went berserk...
  - I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
  - So did your father...
  - So did my father and his father before him.
  - But it's a responsibility...
  - But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
  - I must only let the red rage...
  - You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
  - I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
- - We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
  - Not now, Sven...
  - I must KILL! Kill!
  - It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
- - KILL! KILL!
  - Stop it!
- - HOLD it! HOLD it in!
  - DEATH TO DRAGONS!
- - Well, of course he is!
  - Sh!
- - There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
  - I'm just building up to it, Dad.
- - Well, go on! Go berserk!
  - GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
- - There is nothing we can do...
  - Helpless...
- - He drove me mad!
  - Easy, Dad!
  - And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
  - Dad!
  - I hate you! I hate you!
- - Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
  - Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
  - You could charge him what you like.
- - You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy
    the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
  - Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
  - Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
- - If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
  - Can't make enough swords!
  - Can't make enough axe-heads!
  - But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost,
    the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
- - They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
  - The Age of Ragnarok ends...
  - The bottom falls out of the sword business!
  - It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood
    of ALL blacksmiths.
  - My brother blacksmiths!
  - That's right.
  - The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
  - Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
  - Together we stand!
  - You can't let Erik do THAT.
- - Wasn't it, Keitel?
  - Well... I... I thought...
- - Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
  - How can we stops him now?
- - Sh! Hurry!
  - YOU do it!
  - You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
- - I can't swim! I can't swim!
  - Relax!
  - I'm drowning! Help!
- - Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
  - Help!
  - You'll drown us bo...
- - Help!
  - Help!
- - Shut up!
  - She knows it was our fault!
  - Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
  - No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
- - You've lost your mind.
  - We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
  - You fool!
- - I should have got rid of you long ago!
  - Like you got rid of Snorri!
- - Made by YOU, Loki!
  - By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you?
    Ragnarok was good for his business...
  - It's not my business any more!
- - Well! Come on!
  - I... I...
- - Who's that?
  - It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
  - Oh...
- - What?
  - What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
  - Get away, Snorri.
  - What have you got there?
- - Aaagh!
  - Got you!
- - Let me go, Sven.
  - What are you talking about?
  - I'm not worth risking your life for.
  - I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
  - For your own sake... For the others... I...
  - Hang on...
- - Are you all right?
  - No, I'm not.
  - You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
  - How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
  - I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
- - I know. I know.
  - Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop...
    puke... puke... puke.
  - Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
- - He used to puke in his sleep.
  - Bastard.
- - Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
  - That's it!
- - And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
  - That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
  - Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
- - Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
  - Mum! Dad!
- - You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
  - I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
  - You're wasting your time.
  - Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
  - There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
  - Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
  - Same thing, isn't it?
  - No, it is NOT.
- - You know, my son, our lord said...
  - Your lord.
  - 'Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."'
  - I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
- - What's all the panic about?
  - The Dragon...
- - It can't do you any HARM...
  - What do we have to do?
  - Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
- - How did he do that?
  - Do what?
  - Vanish into thin air?
  - He hasn't.
  - Well, where is he then?
- - Bye, Leif.
  - Bye... sorry...
  - Yeah... well...
  - You will wait?
  - What d'you expect me to do?
- - That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
  - Please.
- - And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
  - I will join my grandfather there.
- - What are you talking about, Erik?
  - What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
- - Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
  - What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
- - Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
  - We'd be the first!
- - But HOW?
  - I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
- - Hey, you two! What's going on?
  - I was sitting there.
- - Look, I bagged it last week.
  - It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
  - Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
  - Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
  - I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
- - I AM one, Dad!
  - We haven't got a spare place.
- - ROW!
  - DEATH!
- - She hasn't got any.
  - She MUST have a knife or something...
- - Hy-Brasil?
  - Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
- - We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
  - Over the Edge of the World.
- - Sven!
  - Let me do something for myself for a change!
- - I came to find my grandfather.
  - I have to go...
- - Wait, Erik!
  - Keitel Blacksmith?
- - Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
  - What's the matter with Bjorn?
- - What do you think?
  - But how could he know... unless...
- - And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
  - But...
- - Well, what else do we do?
  - How about making friends?
- - So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
  - What is it?
- - Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
  - What are you talking about?
- - There is another way.
  - Who gets killed?
  - Nobody gets killed.
- - You need to say a bit more than that!
  - Oh... er... yes...
- - What's the matter with them?
  - Just say something cheerful.
  - Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
- - I think we should go...
  - Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
  - No, don't say anything else!
- - You mean we'd be dead?
  - No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
- - Thank you VERY much indeed.
  - Now stop it!
  - It's SO nice to feel wanted.
  - Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
  - Trust me to get the missionary.
- - You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
  - That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
  - Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
- - That's better.
  - Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on
    the other.
- - Row!
  - Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
- - First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
  - Well, come on!
- - Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding...
    but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
  - Like fish.
- - A magic dishcloth.
  - To the oars!
- - Weren't we supposed to?
  - Oh... I feel a little... oh...
- - No! Let go, Snorri!
  - I've got you!
  - You'll be sucked down too!
  - No! Arrgh!
- - You must help us.
  - We don't HAVE to help anybody.
  - Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
  - Why should WE care?
  - Because... you're... you're the Gods....
  - So?
  - Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
- - Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love
    each other or hate each other.
  - But you're the Gods!
  - Look... Erik...
- - What are YOU doing here?
  - You may need a real Berserk.
- - Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
  - Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
- - SHUT UP!
  - ROW!
- - Look, the sky is blue...
  - The sun! That's it!
- - It's magic.
  - What "magic"?
  - I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
- - What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
  - You'll see!
- - What did he say?
  - Look out!
- - He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
  - Well, you ARE!
- - I want to die...  No, I don't!
  - Row! Row! Row!
- - Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
  - Sorry.
- - Slower! In... Out...
  - Sorry!
- - Faster!
  - Make your mind up.
- - We're missing all the fun...
  - What's it all about?
  - What?
  - We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
  - You talking piffle, son?
  - Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
  - Who have you been talking to?
  - I met this girl...
  - It's always the women that start the trouble.
  - She got me thinking...
  - So? What'd you do to her?
- - I... I... KILLED her...
  - That's my boy!
- - FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
  - Find it... AND cross it!
- - '"But" what?'
  - But...
  - What?
- - Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
  - He was lucky...  Sit there.
- - What are you talking about?
  - Come on, move it!
- - It's Halfdan the Black!
  - I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
- - Erik! Row! What are you doing?
  - It saved my father!
- - How deep IS the ocean?
  - Very deep... usually...
- - Let's hack her to pieces.
  - No.
- - What's wrong with making friends?
  - You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
- - That's terrible!
  - You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
- - Halfdan the Black's here!
  - I know!
  - He wants to KILL us.
- - But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
  - I know. I know.
- - It's not magic! It's just a trick!
  - Don't you FEEL it?
- - Have you done this sort of thing before?
  - Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
  - Looting and pillaging, eh?
  - Yes.
  - What about the raping?
  - Shut up.
  - It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
  - Sh!
- - Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
  - You don't love ME.
  - No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like
    you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort
    of mutual feeling between two people...
  - What -- rape?
  - No. It isn't rape then, is it?
  - Oh, get it over with.
  - I don't suppose... no...
  - What?
  - I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
  - What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to
    rape me...
- - I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
  - About raping me?
  - About NOT raping you...
  - You DON'T like it, do you?
  - Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
  - What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
  - Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
  - Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
  - To pay for the next expedition, of course.
  - But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition
    is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is
    to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
  - Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
  - Well you started it.
  - I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
  - And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing
    and looting that goes on.
- - Scream.
  - Ah.
  - Louder.
  - Aaagh! Rape!
  - Oh, thanks.
- - Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
  - I didn't mean to!
  - Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
- - You told them I raped you -- why?
  - I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
  - Why should you care?
  - Why... should YOU care?
  - Tell me your name?
- - I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
  - What a stupid idea.
  - Why?
  - What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
  - I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
- - Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
  - Well... no...
- - Is THAT Odin?
  - You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
  - Odin!
- - Why should you care?
  - I don't know! I just did!
- - No... we don't...
  - The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the
    whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
- - How?
  - Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
  - Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
  - Well... isn't it great?
- - Would you like us to sing to you?
  - That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
- - What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
  - Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and
    --
  - You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
  - Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
  - A lot of people like our singing.
  - I'm sure it's lovely.
  - But you don't want to hear it.
  - No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
- - Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing
    for us.
  - You're just saying that.
- - Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
  - REALLY?
  - Really.
  - And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
- - No.
  - Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
- - We're just not a very musical nation...
  - No, no... It was very... er, nice.
  - Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really,
    truly, honestly like it?
- - No.
  - They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
- - Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and
    die by the axe and by the sword...
  - Well, how d'you think I feel?
  - The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
  - YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
- - I'll tell you what...
  - Yes?
- - Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
  - You've got to let me go!
- - It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they
    might get angry and then... well...
  - They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
- - He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
  - Why?
  - Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
  - Don't talk nonsense.
  - He wants to kill US!
  - Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
  - You don't know Halfdan the Black.
  - I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will
    keep it for the next thousand.
- - Is there something the matter with it?
  - Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
  - Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play
    the horn, don't you?
  - Yes... oh, yes...
  - Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
- - But it IS! Look!
  - The important thing is not to panic.
- - Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
  - I shouldn't have come.
  - They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
- - What do you see, Erik?
  - I see the world.
  - Is it night or day, Erik?
  - It is day, of course, Freya.
  - Is it summer or winter, Erik?
- - Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
  - The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
  - But have you ever seen it? Think back...
  - Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as
    if the whole sky was blue...
  - The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
- - Is there nothing men can do?
  - The Gods are asleep, Erik.
  - I will go and wake them up!
- - And will the dead ever return, Freya?
  - That I cannot tell you.
- - LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
  - Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage
    their plans.
- - But --
  - It was my master Keitel's idea.
- - But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
  - What d'you mean?
- - How do we know this is the way?
  - We blew the Horn Resounding.
  - SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
- - WHAT did you say?
  - I said welcome.
  - WELCOME?
  - Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
- - How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
  - Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
- - Please! Please! What are those?
  - What are what?
  - Those things in your hands.
  - These? What are THESE? They're swords.
- - What's the matter?
  - PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
  - What?
  - Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
- - WHY?
  - Yes.
  - But surely you know...?
- - Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
  - What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
  - No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
  - You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
  - No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody
    you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem
    to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
  - HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
  - What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
  - It was different...
  - What was she like?
  - Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
  - But you LOVED her all the same...
  - We never went to bed together.
  - Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
  - You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
  - I've never LOVED anybody!
  - I've never been to bed with anybody!
- - The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
  - '"The fifth one this week"!'
  - Oh, for goodness' sake!
  - And I thought you said it was something special...
- - That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
  - Five this week; how many the week before?
  - You're as bad as my father.
  - And the week before that?
- - We mustn't let him land!
  - Who?
  - Halfdan the Black.
  - But, Erik...
- - Just give me a hand.
  - I mean, you could have killed yourself.
- - Where's the Cloak Invisible?
  - Why?
- - No!
  - I'll bring it back.
  - Erik. You don't understand.
  - No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy.
    We brought him here. We must stop him.
  - But you don't realize....
  - Goodbye, Aud...
- - And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
  - No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
- - No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
  - That's right!
- - No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
  - I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
- - YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
  - Of course.
  - Do you believe I love you?
  - I... but I...
  - 'You don''t have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?'
  - Yes -- I believe you do.
  - Then let go!
- - The second note.
  - The second note to wake the Gods...
- - Erik! You've done what you came to do!
  - Not quite...
- - Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
  - There is something I must ask the Gods...
  - No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never
    let you return.
- - Then I shall come too.
  - No... no...
  - I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
  - But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
- - Open up! I know you're in there!
  - Ah! It's my father!
  - Open up! I know you're in there!
- - Right! Where is he?
  - Who, Father?
  - Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
  - There IS no one.
- - Well... where is he?
  - There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
- - Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
  - You're losing your temper!
- - It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here
    with some man or other....
  - I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's
    magic...
- - There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
  - She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
  - It's your fantasy...
  - But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
- - It's all right! It isn't happening!
  - But, Father, it IS!
- - It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
  - Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe
    in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
- - Are you the proprietor?
  - And who might you be, sir?
  - Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
  - I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
- - I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
  - Handsomely?... Who sent you?
  - Pardon me?
  - Never mind. I'm the owner.
- - So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
  - Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
  - I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
- - WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
  - I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
- - Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
  - Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun.
    We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
  - HE'S GONE!
  - When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
  - YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
  - YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your
    monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
  - YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
- - Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
  - Fine.
  - Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room
    with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
  - I've heard.
  - Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt.
    And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the
    man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to
    get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way
    show this man that you are frightened of him...
  - Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go
    in?
  - Yes... Yes, let's go in.
- - The workhouse.
  - Yes! The workhouse!
- - Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
  - Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
- - Won't come out, eh?
  - No, he's very upset about something.
  - Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
- - He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under
    the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
  - Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got
    an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste
    your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh,
    but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr.
    Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
- - Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
  - We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with
    great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
  - Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point.
    You know they won't let him stay here.
  - I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee
    they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles.
    I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him
    to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That
    was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow.
    Mothershead?
- - Watery headed bunch.
  - I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming.
    It was an act of the greatest charity.
- - Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day,
    Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
  - Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
  - Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
  - I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
  - Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes
    contact with people outside the hospital...
  - But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything
    for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
  - Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated
    John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
  - I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness
    can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving
    kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
  - You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything
    you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But,
    I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late,
    so please forgive me.
- - Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
  - Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
  - Yes sir.  What's that?
  - A dressing bag.
  - Very smart indeed.
  - Yes. John wants it.
  - A dressing bag?
  - You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
  - Well...
  - John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined
    to agree.
- - So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
  - Welcome home, John.
- - Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
  - Yes John!
- - '...Yyes'
  - Yyyess.
  - Yyess.
  - That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
  - Yes!
  - Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want
    you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
    I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do
    you understand?
  - Yes.
  - Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
  - Hello...
  - My name is...
  - My... name is...
  - John Merrick.
  - John... Merrick
  - Say "Merrick".
  - Merrick...
  - Say "Mmmerrick."
  - Mmmerrick.
  - Say "Mmmerrick."
  - Mmmerrick.
  - Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello
    ...
  - Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
- - Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you
    please introduce yourself?
  - Hello, my name is John Merrick.
- - 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green
    pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth
    me in the paths of righteousness...'
  - Righteousness...
  - Righteousness for his namesake.
  - Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it
    exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will
    say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll
    help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done
    for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now,
    let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce
    you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
  - Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
- - John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
  - Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
- - Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
  - Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
- - '...Yes potatoes... but...'
  - But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
- - Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't
    you tell me you could read?
  - You did not ask me.
  - I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
  - Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much.
    People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive
    me.
  - We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
- - Good evening. How are you feeling?
  - Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
  - Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it,
    it's very popular.
- - This... is my new home?
  - Yes.
  - The hospital?
  - Of course! What did you think?
- - How long will I stay here?
  - I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You
    will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room,
    don't you think?
- - You look splendid, John.
  - Thank you very much.
  - When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
- - John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
  - I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
- - Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
  - That's a canopy, John.
  - Ohhh...
  - How is your tea, John?
  - It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of
    you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
  - Not at all, John.
  - I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way
    it's done in most houses?
  - Oh yes.
  - Who are they of?
  - Oh, our relatives... the children.
  - The children! May I see?
  - Of course.
- - The Children. Where are your children
  - Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
  - Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
- - Would you... would you like to see my mother?
  - Your mother?
  - Here.
- - Good morning, John.
  - Good morning.
  - John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
- - When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be
    aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When
    will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
  - Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart
    beats Nothing will die.
- - Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
  - Yes, John?
  - '...Can you cure me?'
- - No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
  - I thought as much.
- - The cathedral is coming along nicely.
  - Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first,
    How kind of her!
- - How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get
    for you?
  - Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could
    possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something
    I could give to you.
  - Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something
    just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
- - You want a dressing bag, John?
  - You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
- - '...my... home?'
  - Yes, John.
  - You did this for me?
  - Yes.
  - Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to
    merit their kindness.
- - My home.
  - There is one more thing, John. Here.
- - Is it the one you wanted?
  - Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
  - Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
  - Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
- - Mr. Treves! Treves.
  - John.... how can you ever forgive me?
- - Stand up, John. Let them see you.
  - Oh no, I couldn't.
  - It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
- - Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
  - Yes, very soon.
  - Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped
    your enjoyed yourself this evening.
  - Oh yes! It was wonderful!
  - I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
- - Yes John?
  - Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that
    you can see?
  - No, John, not one that I can see.
  - Then I shouldn't change anything?
  - No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
- - Goodnight John. Sleep well.
  - You too, my friend. Goodnight.
- - Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
  - Yes.
- - Thank you very much.
  - Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
  - No, nothing.
- - Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
  - Good morning.
- - What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good,
    I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
  - Yes.
  - But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
  - Thank you... very much.
  - Where did you get this box?
- - The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
  - I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought
    it has been thrown away.
  - It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little
    dirty, that's all.
- - What's this?
  - The main spire.
  - The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where
    did you learn to do this?
  - '...I learned a long time ago.'
- - I'll have to find some more.
  - Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
- - You alright?
  - y-y-yes--
  - Want to come out?
  - You're English.
  - Of course! You want out?
  - Yes.
  - Won't be a moment.
- - I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
  - Oh no, my friend...
  - Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
  - Oh, yes.
  - You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
- - John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs.
    Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
  - Good day, Mr. Merrick.
- - It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you
    select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess
    Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
  - I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget
    his ordeal. John will be very excited.
  - Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert
    care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
  - I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head
    has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
  - How awful for John.
  - And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
  - Is he... dying then?
  - Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more
    useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient
    is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
  - Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
  - Yes.
- - Good day...!
  - I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't
    think it too forward.
  - Oh, no.
  - I knew you'd understand. Here.
- - I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
  - Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it
    a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
- - She's very pretty, your mother.
  - Yes.
- - Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
  - Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
  - Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
  - You've never been?
  - Alas, no.
  - Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course,
    I'm rather partial.
  - Tell me about it, please!
  - It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the
    shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere
    in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings,
    unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all
    in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything
    you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the
    brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety
    and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
  - Romance!
  - That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something
    else for you...
- - Have you read it?
  - No, but I certainly shall.
- - Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  - Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
  - O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith
    turn to despair.
- - Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
  - Oh no?
  - Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
- - Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such
    as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
  - Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
  - O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be
    glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me,
    Kate?
  - Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
  - An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
  - O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
  - What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
  - Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
  - I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker
    is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back
    will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair
    face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun
    and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never
    changes, but keeps his course truly.
- - How long has this man been here?
  - Three quarters of an hour.
  - Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's
    a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
- - Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
  - What a mess.
- - I say Freddie, what are you about?
  - Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
- - Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
  - You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of
    you Fox, keep it to yourself.
  - Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
  - I don't know what I've got.
  - Nothing of any importance, eh?
- - You never mentioned his mental state.
  - He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No,
    the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
- - How are you feeling today?
  - I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
  - I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
  - I feel much better. Thank you.
  - Are you comfortable here?
  - Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
- - '...I... everyone has been very kind to me.'
  - Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
- - '...everyone has been very kind.'
  - Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
- - What is it, Treves?
  - Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest
    my head with oil...
- - It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
  - I am very pleased to meet you.
  - I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
- - Good morning, Treves.
  - Good morning, sir.
  - You've acquired a taste for this?
  - It's quite nutritious, sir.
  - Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
- - Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
  - Indeed!
- - A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures
    about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted,
    and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
  - No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
  - Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
  - Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find
    him... rather shocking.
  - Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
  - Yes sir.
  - What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept
    incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
  - Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
  - Oh, is he a friend of yours?
  - No, more of an acquaintance.
- - I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British
    Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
  - Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
- - Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
  - Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
  - Good! How is the patient?
  - He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I
    were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a
    chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease,
    but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear
    him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather
    than as a violation of the rules.
  - A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
  - Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
  - I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will
    be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they
    are.
  - I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without
    at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never
    met.
  - No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly,
    let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the
    other members of the committee.
  - Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
  - Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what
    the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
- - Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in
    my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
  - Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
  - Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
  - Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
  - Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has
    become rather more than just an acquaintance.
  - '...Yes, Sir.'
- - It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the
    constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness
    to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding
    what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
  - Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
- - '...As I said, it''s only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick
    is very flattered that you''re taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he''s
    most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.'
  - He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries
    we spoke about?
  - Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid
    that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their
    next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
  - Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves.
    But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here.
    Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just
    don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
- - Oh yes?
  - And what was that, John?
- - It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
  - Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do
    anything I could to protect him.
  - I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else,
    where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better
    that it worked out this way. Good day.
- - How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
  - I don't understand.
  - Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
- - Treves. Well done.
  - Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
- - Can you imagine what his life has been like?
  - Yes, I think I can.
  - No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
- - You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that
    the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
  - I could easily arrange...
  - No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly.
    It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
  - Well, yes.
  - Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case
    to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been
    affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
  - Do you think they'll go along with us?
  - Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
- - Don't we?
  - No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take
    Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
  - Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
- - Has the response picked up?
  - Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers.
    Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
  - But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
  - Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
  - Please do.
- - Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
  - Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
- - What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
  - What do you mean?
  - He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
  - I intend to.
- - What happened?
  - He fell.  He falls.
  - He must have taken quite a fall.
- - He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
  - Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
  - That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
- - This man belongs in hospital.
  - Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
  - You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's
    got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by
    his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
- - I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I
    know I can trust you. Can't I?
  - Everything will be seen to.
- - I want my man back.
  - Just a moment, how did you get in here?
  - Never mind that, I want my man!
  - He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
  - DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's
    leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
  - You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's
    my patient now and I must do what...
  - Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
  - I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
  - He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners.
    You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
  - All you do is profit from another man's misery!
  - You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums
    and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the
    name of science! And now I want him back.
  - You don't own this man!
  - I want him back!
  - So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better
    with you!
  - I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
- - Now I think we really do understand one another.
  - Right... Right.
- - You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
  - Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
  - He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
  - He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
  - If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
- - What are you going to do?
  - I'll show you! I'll show you!
- - Don't!
  - Shut up!
- - Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
  - Yes?
  - I found it.
  - Did you see it?
- - Our man is sick. Come right away.
  - What is it?
  - Like this.
  - I'll get my bag.
- - You won't be long?
  - I'll join you shortly.
- - Did it go well, darling?
  - Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
  - Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
  - No, I think a whiskey.
- - Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
  - I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic
    phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way.
    Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
  - What do you mean?
  - Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable
    of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to
    please me.
  - But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
  - He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or
    is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
- - Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
  - I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the
    body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free
    that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible.
    But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch,
    well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't
    be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and
    untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
- - Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities
    he doesn't possess?
  - And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
  - I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
- - I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
  - Well, these things take time.
  - I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him.
    Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like
    an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering
    the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
- - John loves the house.
  - Do you?
- - Yes.
  - And here are my mother and father.
- - You stay with me.
  - Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
- - More romances for John?
  - Hmmm?
  - '...Freddie! What''s the matter? You''ve been like this all evening.'
  - Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
  - Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
  - That I am very little different from him.
  - Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier
    and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is
    completely due to you.
  - But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his
    last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
  - Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
  - '...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?'
  - Oh Frederick.
- - Mr. Merrick, sugar?
  - Yes please, two.
  - One or two?
  - Two, please.
- - Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
  - Oh?
- - And here is one of Frederick's mother.
  - How lovely.
- - They have noble faces.
  - I've always thought that myself.
  - Oh, yes.
- - Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
  - She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to
    me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she
    was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment
    to her.
  - Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
  - If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely
    kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love
    me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
- - So that's the one you want to marry.
  - With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
  - Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather
    sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
  - That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're
    supposed to be my niece.
- - Uncle, you can't do this!
  - My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
  - It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
- - This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
  - I thought everything was working out fine.
  - Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow
    Firefly.
  - Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
- - If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
  - Perhaps he will listen to you...
- - Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's
    financial aid --
  - What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
  - Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
  - Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first
    lady of the land.
- - '...but would further cement the relations of our countries.'
  - Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
  - Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
  - Well no -- not exactly -- but --
  - Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't
    you see that I'm at your feet?
- - Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
  - I didn't come here to be insulted.
- - I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable
    occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
  - This is terrible!
- - Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up
    with his Excellency.
  - Oh, would you...?
  - For you, I would do anything...
- - What'll I do with this card?
  - You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
- - In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything
    you stand for.
  - Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some
    improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six
    in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't
    matriculate, now what were you saying?
  - The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's
    footsteps.
  - I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not
    that I care -- but where is your husband?
  - Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
  - No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you
    see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
  - Your Excellency!
  - You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're
    facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything
    including, you.
- - Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land
    are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
  - Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
  - If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell
    us how you intend to run the nation.
  - 'These are the laws of my administration: No one''s allowed to smoke or tell a
    dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...'
- - You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see
    you have an open mind.
  - That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
  - Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives...
    Have you got your speech ready?
  - I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score
    and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
    --
  - Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
  - He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
- - Oh, Rufus!
  - All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
  - Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
  - I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest
    something.
- - So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a
    dime...
  - But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came
    to ask you to patch up the breach.
  - Let him patch up his own breeches...
- - Oh, won't you reconsider...
  - Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget
    what he called me.
- - Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy
    gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you
    see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt
    of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
  - Now -- er --
  - Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger
    the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and
    speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll
    never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
  - Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
- - Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
  - Why -- why -- of course.
  - You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born
    my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
- - I hope I'm not interrupting.
  - Take a seat -- you're next.
  - Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
  - That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
- - My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
  - WHAT  ?
- - I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
  - Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
  - I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
  - THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless
    victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
  - But -
  - You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and
    the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
- - You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to
    govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
  - The king can do no wrong!
- - That's even a greater honor.
  - I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
  - I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need
    right now is twenty million dollars.
  - Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with
    my Minister of Finance.
  - Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
  - $50?
  - I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If
    you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make
    it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
  - Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
  - Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you
    tried a little harder.
- - Excellency, may I present my niece.
  - Go ahead.
  - You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
  - And Vera niece, too.
- - When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to
    a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria,
    I love you.  I --
  - Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
  - What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but
    we can have a little family of our own.
- - This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
  - Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
- - That's what you think.
  - You swine!
  - Give me that again!
  - You worm!
  - Once more!
  - You upstart!
  - That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
- - Then it's war?
  - Yes.
  - How're ya fixed for ammunition?
  - Bah!!
  - THEN IT'S WAR!
- - I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
  - Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves...
    and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
  - I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
  - Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit,
    besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
- - What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
  - I don't remember.
  - Oh -- you mean... worm?
  - No, that wasn't it...
  - Was it -- swine?
  - No... it was a seven letter word.
  - Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
  - That's it...
- - Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course
    is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
  - I still like UPSTART the best.
- - Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of
    you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
  - You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?
- - You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
  - Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of
    it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
- - Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
  - Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
- - I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
  - This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
  - Are you getting tired?
  - Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
- - Are you sure you're not tired?
  - Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
- - We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
  - If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
  - If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
  - If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll
    put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man
    nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this
    country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is
    low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of
    money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be
    fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now,
    Just wait 'till I get through with it.
- - I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up
    and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my
    share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
  - So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless
    he gets his share.
  - If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one
    she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband
    steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
  - The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the
    wall And take him for a ride.
  - The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years
    To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree,
    we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
- - How'm I doing, boss?
  - Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about
    your cousin?
  - He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving
    him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
- - Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man
    who's willing to die, if necessary.
  - All right -- I'll go out and find one.
  - Firefly must be captured at any cost.
  - That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
  - It must be done right away.
  - I can't do it right away.
- - Hey you!!
  - All right -
- - Have you got a license?
  - No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
  - What kind of a dog is he?
  - He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
  - Well - what is he now?
  - He's half poodle and half watch dog -
  - Half watch dog?
  - Yeh, he's only got one eye.
  - I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine
    year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
  - I don't call him, I whistle.
  - What do you whistle?
  - Yankee Poodle.
  - I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any
    digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
  - I don't want him.
  - Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
  - He only weighs ten ounces --
  - I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands
    dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
- - That was for you.
  - I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here,
    my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
  - Oh no, I can't do it.
  - You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
  - Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
  - You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
  - '''At''s-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.'
  - Did you shoot the rapids?
  - No, but I shot some ducks.
  - If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway,
    I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and
    I'll make you vice-president of the country.
  - Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's
    the last we ever heard of him.
  - Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
- - Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He
    wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
  - I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how
    about my proposition?
  - What other job you got?
  - Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would
    you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
  - That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
  - Then you don't wanna work hard?
  - I don't wanna work at all.
  - In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll
    put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
  - I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
  - Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
  - Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven
    -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a
    six month vacation.
  - I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
  - '''At''s-a fine.'
- - You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just
    made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy
    it from me and I get 10% commission.
  - What do I get?
  - You get half mine and I get half yours.
  - I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
  - Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
  - Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
- - My card.
  - That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I
    come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't
    like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
  - Why wasn't I insulted?
  - You was insulted, but you don't know it.
  - Then I demand an apology!
  - That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap
    of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
  - You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to
    me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How
    about him?
  - He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped
    my face.
  - Why didn't his niece slap your face?
  - She did.
  - What did you say to her?
- - You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where
    did you hear that story?
  - You told it to me.
  - Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she
    told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and
    get yourself an army.
- - Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
  - I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
- - Send in the next girl.
  - By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
  - Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side
    what we're doing?
- - I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
  - We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how
    to make love?
- - He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
  - That's not bad for any day.
- - You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
  - I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
- - You no gotta no gun.
  - Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
- - Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get
    out there and fight...
  - I can't do it...
  - Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
  - Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
  - Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't
    be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
- - Now -- how many men you got in your army?
  - Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
  - That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
  - That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start
    even.
  - That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
  - No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
  - Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
  - We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
  - I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya
    fixed for cavalry?
  - I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
  - That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
  - That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
  - Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now,
    I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through
    their maneuvers.
  - Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
- - With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
  - That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
  - Anything else?
  - Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and
    throw in some matches.
  - Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're
    you fixed for spys?
  - Fine.  We gotta him.
  - So! -- He's on your side, too.
  - Sure.
  - Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble
    keeping the wolf from the door.
- - I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
  - Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
  - Yes -- why?
  - I wanna powder my nose...
- - In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
  - He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
- - What's the matter with you?
  - What's the matter with you?
  - You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had
    neurosis --
  - I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
- - Here I am, Father.
  - Take a letter.
  - Who to?
  - The President of the United States.
- - My dear President...  read it back...
  - '"My dear President"...'
  - That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
  - '"My dear"...'
  - That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it
    read now?
  - '"My President"...'
  - There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you
    got?
  - '"My"...'
  - Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
  - '"My dear"...'
  - You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear
    how sounds.
  - '"My dear President"...'
  - That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
  - Is that all?
  - Take another letter...  to my tailor.
- - Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
  - I'll have to enclose the check first.
  - You do and I'll fire you.
- - Here I am, Father...
  - Send for my car...
  - His Excellency's car!
- - Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if
    you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking
    get me a bag of peanuts.
  - I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
  - He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
  - But you're my father -
  - Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
- - In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
  - About - thirty-four seconds.
  - We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
- - Father...
  - Take a letter...
- - Who to?
  - None of your business...  Take another letter.

    wrong

  - Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She
    might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
  - The king can do to wrong!
  - King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list

    wrong.
  - We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.

  - Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.

  - You get nothing, Hank, okay?
  - I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
  - There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna

- - '...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."'
  - A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
- - '...Today''s "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits
    for the "Physical Fitness" number --'
  - Nothin' too showy!
  - Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
- - Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
  - Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
- - Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for
    some of them.
  - That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
- - Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
  - You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
- - It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
  - I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some
    outfits.
  - All right, let's go.
- - Oh! What is it?
  - '"Proud... to be... an... American."'
- - Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that
    she was so young.
  - It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding
    thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
  - You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
  - Yeah.
- - So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
  - Okay, everybody, listen up!
  - Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
- - Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this
    is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
  - Uh, Gladys?
  - What!
  - We need more bars!
  - This is -- what?
  - Enid ate a whole pan!
  - I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
- - '...You betcha. S''posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...'
  - Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
  - Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
  - We're not in the showroom, Dear.
- - Lester?
  - Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
- - Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
  - Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
  - Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
- - Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
  - Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won.
    I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo,
    they love that.
- - Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on
    fire!
  - Gladys! Stop it!
  - Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
- - So help me, Gladys.
  - Becky was my only shot at state!
  - That's enough!
  - Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
- - '...Oh, yeah-right. I ain''t gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened
    to that dork-ass farm girl.'
  - Tammy Curry?
  - Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins
    everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
  - This pageant's like a roach motel.
  - Girls check in, but they don't check out.
  - Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
  - Yeah.
- - What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably
    ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
  - I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
- - Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good
    idea?
  - Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged
    women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to
    the girls --
- - So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
  - Last year? It was, "Buy American."
  - And the year before that?
  - '"U.S.A. is A-okay."'
  - Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
  - '"Can I? I''m Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don''t know, it''s...
    maybe a gift from God or somethin''.'
- - I'm a mirror.
  - Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota
    American Teen Princess State Board.
  - We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are
    at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend
    and put her address.
  - That's right.
  - Okay?
  - Mm-hm.
- - People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage
    from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
  - Yeah.
  - Dakota.
  - Ohio...
  - That bitch from...
  - What?
  - Wisconsin.
  - All right, then.
  - The bitch.
  - The important thing is that we have a winner...
- - Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know?
    I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
  - She's the winner and we're going to state.
- - C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have
    to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
  - It smells funny. Like gasoline.
  - Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
  - My dress'll reek.
  - Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there
    and show me some teeth.
- - What do you mean, they take out her butt?
  - Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
  - Are we on "Cops" again?
  - You could be quiet.
  - Hi.
  - Hi.
  - It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I
    told you about 'em.
  - Oh, naw. Hi.
  - This here's Loretta.
  - I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be
    talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
- - Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
  - Loretta, shut it.
  - Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
  - Shut it up, Loretta.
  - Oh, Christ, it's true.
- - Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
  - Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
  - She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
  - '"Most smartest?" Oh, that''s good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that.
    "Most smartest." We''re cuttin you off and sendin'' you home.'
- - Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be
    the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
  - I'll be right back. See ya later.
- - They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
  - All right, they're makin' a movie.
  - You don't know where this is gonna...
  - I got a hairdo.
- - Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
  - So? Be real easy.
  - Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
  - Anyone?
- - Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy
    wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
  - Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax
    a bit.
- - We was robbed.
  - Okay. Take her purse.
- - Annette, just use your hand.
  - They told me to practice.
- - Hi...
  - Hi.
- - Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
  - NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
- - Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
  - Then it must be Wednesday.
- - So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
  - I know.
  - So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
- - Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh,
    maybe I could call you tonight.
  - Yah-sure, fine... fine.
  - Okay... well, bye.
  - Bye.
- - Here, I didn't get any.
  - Here, have some.
- - So, anyone talk to Janelle?
  - Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom.
    She's super happy.
- - Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my
    neck?
  - Yeah...
  - And the bite marks on my ears?
  - Yes...
  - I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
  - Yes, Leslie!
- - What're you doin' here?
  - Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
- - What?
  - You heard me. Where is it?
- - If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
  - I just did.
  - Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
- - Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
  - Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
  - Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
- - If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
  - Bitch!
- - Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number
    one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical
    Fitness" routine...
  - Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
- - Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical
    Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
  - No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'?
    I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
- - I hate her!
  - We all do. Now let's go.
- - Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know
    what's goin' on?
  - Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta
    be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
  - But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
  - Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
  - This, this... This is bullshit!
  - Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
  - Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
- - '...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter
    in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.'
  - Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
  - That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
- - Oh shit!
  - They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
  - Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt,
    get the money first.
- - Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
  - Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA-
    BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing
    I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
- - Go on! Get out!
  - Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
- - Mom!
  - I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd
    kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
  - Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no.
    I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
  - What?!
- - Ow!
  - Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
- - Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
  - You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy
    Pop feels.
  - Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
  - Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode
    hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to
    end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
  - That's it, I'm goin'...
  - Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute
    I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have
    you...
- - God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
  - It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's
    your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
  - C'mere. I love you so much.
  - I love you much.
- - Bye mom.
  - We was robbed.
  - It's okay.
- - Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap
    whore.
  - Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to
    make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
  - -- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
- - Amber...
  - No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
- - I'm gonna need more caps.
  - You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
  - Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
  - No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
- - I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
  - Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special
    to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned
    Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely
    daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
- - Mrs. Leeman?
  - Huh?
  - I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
  - Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
    but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And
    this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow
    a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
  - But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything
    wrong...
- - Oh, Amber...
  - I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
  - I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
- - Amber? Here.
  - '"Here," wh-wh-what?'
  - My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant.
    You can wear it.
- - Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family
    only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
  - Your parents'd kill you.
  - Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
  - Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
  - Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when
    he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't
    know, got her back.
  - Yah?
  - Oh-you-beccha.
- - Is Mom okay?
  - She's alive, sweetie.
  - Where is she?!
  - She's right over there.
- - Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
  - Don't let that worry you, Annette!
- - You're what?!
  - I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
  - I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes,
    Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn
    lawn dart!
  - Oh God, I'm dead...
- - So, what do I say?
  - Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams
    -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could
    have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know
    what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
  - Oh my God. I'm so dead...
  - Yeah, you betcha...
- - Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
  - No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
- - '"Once a carnie, always a carnie."'
  - Oh-yah.
- - That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
  - Really, Loretta?
  - You-betcha.
  - My mom wanted me to have this?
  - Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
  - Loretta, never have kids.
  - Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
- - Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the
    back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
  - Thank God for bunge cords.
  - '...Yah -- well, at least, y''know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I
    guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...'
- - What is wrong with you?
  - I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
  - You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
  - Really?
  - No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy
    it. Let's get you a root beer float.
  - Okay.
  - Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
- - I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that.
    The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
  - This came for you, sweetie.
  - Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
- - It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a
    "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a
    choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
  - What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
  - I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
  - Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
  - There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
- - All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
  - Airport Ho-Jo!
  - I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
- - Loretta, don't do that.
  - I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
  - I gotta work with these women.
  - Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
- - I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
  - Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
  - I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
- - Chut up!
  - Go back to China, bitch!
- - Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
  - You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
  - There's no rule!
  - Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed
    to go straight home.
- - All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
  - Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
- - What is this shit?
  - Raspberry.
- - Wicked.
  - No more fuckin' for her.
  - Smurfette doesn't fuck.
  - Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her,
    'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
  - Not Vanity. He's a homo.
- - We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
  - I stole four beers from my dad.
- - Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
  - Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child.
    Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
  - Kitty...
  - The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children
    that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
- - And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water
    main!
  - This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
  - I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
- - Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
  - The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
- - Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
  - I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
- - Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since
    this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
  - Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together
    for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour
    today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous.
    I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb
    to the path of fear.
- - Rose.
  - Kitty...
  - Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations
    against Jim Cunningham.
  - Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
  - Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated
    by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent
    man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign.
    But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which
    involves you.
  - Beg pardon?
  - Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know,
    the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach...
    I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
  - But now you can't go.
  - Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you,
    given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to
    go.
  - Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
  - Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters.
    This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment
    to Sparkle Motion.
- - I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
  - What else?
  - What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
- - Christ. Is that an axe?
  - Yep.
  - How did this happen?
  - I guess they made him do it.
- - I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
  - If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point
    when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
- - Excuse me?
  - Donnie? You're a dick.
- - Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
  - That's enough.
  - You can suck a fuck.
- - No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
  - How did you know --
  - I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
  - It is a big deal.
  - I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
- - Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And
    I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
  - Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
- - Our son just called me a bitch.
  - You're not a bitch.
- - So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So
    we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking
    the money out of savings.
  - You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
- - What?
  - Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
  - He was a year ahead of us?
  - He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
- - Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
  - What I think is going on with your son.
  - Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression...
    He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
- - Has your son ever told you about Frank?
  - Come again?
  - Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
  - Frank?
  - Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
  - You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
  - He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe
    to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
- - I... What can we do?
  - I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
- - If that's what you think is necessary.
  - But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
- - How much are they paying you to be here?
  - Excuse me? What's your name, son?
  - Gerald.
  - Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
  - Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
- - I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled...
    confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
  - Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
- - Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy.
    Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all
    of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
  - Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
- - It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
  - What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
  - Guess who wrote it?
- - So I hear you have a girlfriend.
  - Yeah.
  - What's her name?
  - You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
  - Why would I tell Mom?
  - Because you tell Mom everything.
  - No I don't.  She worries about you.
  - Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
  - It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told
    me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
  - I was just being honest.
  - Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest,
    the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
  - Her name is Gretchen.
  - That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
- - I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
  - Congratulations.
- - Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should
    throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
  - Okay, but it has to be a small one.
  - Everything is going to be just fine.
- - Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
  - I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You
    know, abuse her. Psychologically.
  - All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
- - So, I met a new friend.
  - Would you like to talk about this friend?
  - His name is Frank.
  - Frank.
  - I think he saved my life.
  - How so?
  - Don't you watch the news?
  - I don't own a television.
  - A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank
    on the golf course.
- - Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
  - He said to follow him.
  - Follow him where?
  - Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
- - Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
  - No.  That's stupid.
- - And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
  - Yes.
  - So, tell me about your day, Donald.
  - I met a girl.
  - What is her name?
  - Gretchen. We're going together now.
  - Do you think a lot about girls?
  - Yes.
  - How are things going at school?
  - I think about girls a lot.
  - I asked you about school.
  - I think about... fucking a lot during school.
  - What else do you think about during school?
  - I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
  - Who is the boss?
  - I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
  - What about your family, Donnie?
  - No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
  - Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
- - How many times have you seen Frank?
  - Four times... so far.
  - Can anyone else see him?
  - I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one
    else's.
  - Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
  - I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought
    it was ridiculous.
  - A sign from whom?
  - I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time
    travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random
    coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the
    creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
  - How does that make you feel?
  - It reminded me of my dog Callie.
  - Is Callie still around?
  - No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled
    underneath our back porch...
  - Do you feel alone right now?
- - I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just
    choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking
    about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end,
    I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because
    it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
  - No. That makes you keep searching.
- - And they grow out of our stomachs?
  - It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way
    that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each
    one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
  - What did you find?
- - Nothing.
  - Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
  - Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
  - Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
  - You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing.
    I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your
    turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing
    about yourself.
- - Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual
    fantasies all the time too.
  - I know.
  - I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our
    first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just
    don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
  - The good stuff.
  - Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
  - Have you ever made love, Donald?
- - And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
  - Yes.
  - So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
  - I... I was playing with fire.
  - Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
- - People get hurt.
  - But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
  - People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
  - But you were punished.
  - Yes. I went to jail.
  - Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
  - They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
  - What did you want for Christmas that year?
  - Hungry Hungry Hippos.
  - How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
  - Regret.
  - What else makes you feel regret?
  - That I did it again.
  - You've done it again?
  - Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I
    only have a few days left... before they catch me.
  - Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
- - I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey
    him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
  - If God exists?
  - I think now that he might...
  - Why?
  - Because I'm so horny.
  - God exists because you're horny.
  - I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep
    going.
  - Where are we going?
- - Where are we going, Donald?
  - I have the power to build a time machine.
  - How is that possible?
  - Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
  - Then how is time travel possible?
  - It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back
    in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
  - When will this happen?
  - Soon. Time is almost up.
- - What is going to happen?
  - Frank is going to kill.
  - Who is he going to kill?
- - I can see him right now!
  - Where is he, Donald?
  - He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this.
    The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
  - If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be
    no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made
    and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious
    is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself.
    Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
  - It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
  - You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must
    let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
- - Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
  - Thank you.
  - Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You
    are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof
    of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
  - Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
  - Goodbye, Donald.
- - Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can
    give us your opinion?
  - Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they
    flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that
    they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they
    tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
- - Who is Frank?
  - A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
- - And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could
    be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
  - Why should we care?
  - Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
  - Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
  - Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
  - Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge
    of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny.
    And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know
    who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits
    to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
- - Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
  - Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
  - Where are you going?
  - I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer
    your English teacher. They fired me.
  - That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
  - Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike
    most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
  - What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
  - Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children
    to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
- - What's "Cellar Door"?
  - A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language,
    of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door"
    is the most beautiful.
- - Cellar door.
  - Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
- - So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
  - I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
  - Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits.
    Go.
- - So how was school today?
  - It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime.
    And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
  - Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof.
    Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
  - Do they know yet?
  - Know what?
  - Where it came from?
  - No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching
    serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk
    to anyone about it.
  - So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
  - You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
- - Oh, shit!
  - Grandma Death.
- - Grandma Death.
  - You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
- - You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to
    try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older,
    she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all
    by herself.
  - I guess she just lost faith in the world.
- - Who's been giving you weird looks?
  - A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some
    reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
- - You're my only son...
  - I know, Dad.
  - I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life...
    whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in
    your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny...
    and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But
    what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full
    of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than
    all of them.
- - Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
  - No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
- - You're such a fuck-ass.
  - When did you stop taking your medication?
- - Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
  - We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
- - I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
  - I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
  - You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't
    recognise this person today.
  - Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
- - Grandma Death.
  - That is a terrible nickname.
- - He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie...
    are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
  - Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
- - I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
  - Do you get to meet Ed?
  - If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on
    Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she
    can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
  - How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
  - It feels wonderful.
- - I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
  - Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
  - I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's
    too simple.
  - The Lifeline is divided that way.
  - Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned
    the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
  - Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
  - Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that
    need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.
    You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying
    everything else.
- - People aren't that simple.
  - If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
- - Hey...
  - Hey...
  - School's cancelled.
- - Wanna walk me home?
  - Sure.
- - Don't look so freaked.
  - I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
  - Fuck them.
- - So... you just moved here?
  - Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He
    has... emotional problems.
  - Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
  - He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
- - Wow. Did he go to jail?
  - He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and
    stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
  - I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was
    abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I
    think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both.
    Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know,
    change things.
  - Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
  - What makes you think I'm not?
- - I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest
    invention ever to benefit mankind.
  - That's easy. Antiseptics.
- - I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics
    there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
  - You mean soap?
  - Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you
    and I would never live to see the year 2000.
  - Wonder where we'll be then.
  - The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never
    get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there
    it is again... perfect.
  - Until it withers away.
- - It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
  - Why is that?
  - We never would have had this conversation.
- - You're weird.
  - I'm sorry.
  - That was a compliment.
  - Will you go with me?
  - Where are we going?
  - No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going
    together.
  - Sure.
- - Where are you going?
  - I'm going home.
- - So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
  - No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got
    there.
  - My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
- - It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger...
    and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
  - So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
  - No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there
    next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian
    Ridge.
  - And you'd never been there before?
- - Donnie?
  - Yeah?
  - Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
  - Why?
  - Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking
    ...is someone showing you the way.
- - What happened to your neck?
  - I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
- - Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories...
    for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
  - Why not just buy your baby a night light?
  - That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours
    of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
  - With, like, images?
  - Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful
    the world can be.
- - You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
  - And what?
  - Well...
  - You want to kiss me...
- - That's alright... I understand.
  - No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
  - I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the
    world can be.
  - Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
- - We're moving through time.
  - What?
- - They suspended me for two days.
  - Are you okay?
  - I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma
    Death is?
  - Who?
  - The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
- - Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
  - She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been
    seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
- - I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
  - Maybe she's asleep.
- - So, we call them... IMGs.
  - Infant Memory Generators.
  - Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear
    them at night when they sleep.
  - And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of
    something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put
    inside.
- - What? How long was I asleep?
  - The whole movie. Let's go.
- - You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
  - What's wrong with you?
  - What do you mean?
- - Will you please talk to me?
  - Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
  - Then when? I have to talk to you.
- - Hey.
  - Hey. You OK?
  - My mom is gone.
  - Where is she?
  - I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
  - But you're OK?
- - Did you call the cops?
  - Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
- - I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's
    my fucking stepdad. I know it.
  - It's safe here.
- - What?
  - There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just
    fine.
- - Come with me.
  - Where are we going?
- - Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
  - Why? Is this about the book?
  - No. Frank.
  - Who's Frank?
- - Is that a cellar door?
  - Yeah...
- - DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times
    last night!
  - We went to a hotel.
  - My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
  - I don't wanna talk about it.
- - How old is Grandma Death?
  - A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never
    any mail.
- - What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
  - Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
- - How can you do that?
  - I can do anything I want... and so can you...
- - Why did you make me flood the school?
  - We just want to guide you in the right direction.
  - Who is... we?
  - You'll know soon enough.
  - Where did you come from?
  - Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
- - I want to show you something.
  - You have to do something for me first.
  - You have a request?
  - Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
  - Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
  - Take it off. I want to see you.
- - What happened to your eye?
  - I am so sorry.
  - Why do they call you Frank?
  - It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
  - How much longer is this gonna last?
  - You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show
    you.
- - Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
  - I didn't say shit.
  - That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
  - Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
  - You know what? I think that you did it.
- - Dea ex machina...
  - What did you say?
  - Our saviour...
- - When can I squeeze one out?
  - Not until like... eighth grade.
- - Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
  - When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
  - I'm telling Mom.
- - What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
  - You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- - '"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.'
  - Donnie! Give it back!
- - Dr. Monnitoff?
  - Donnie.
  - I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about
    time travel?
- - So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for
    jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
  - So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something
    that can travel faster than the speed of light --
  - Theoretically.
  - -- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
  - A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole
    in space controlled by man.
  - So... that's it?
  - The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the
    portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
- - Like a DeLorean.
  - A metal craft of any kind.
- - What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
  - Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they
    do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
  - Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part
    of their natural development.
- - Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre
    of gravity.
  - Like a spear.
  - Beg pardon?
  - Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
  - Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the
    portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
  - Could these wormholes appear in nature?
  - That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
  - If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing
    travels along a set path.
  - I'm not following you.
  - If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see
    into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
  - You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest
    themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen
    destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed
    destiny would end.
  - Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
  - Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
- - Hi... what's going on here?
  - Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
  - What happened?
  - He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
- - What was his name?
  - Donnie. Donnie Darko.
- - I feel bad for his family.
  - Yeah.
  - Did you know him?
- - Good morning, mongrels!
  - Good morning...
  - That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
  - Good MORNING!
  - Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID...
    just to say GOOD MORNING!
  - GOOD MORNING!
  - Are you AFRAID?
  - GOOD MORNING!
  - Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are
    paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they
    surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.
    Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
- - Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
  - Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
  - I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick
    or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
  - Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
- - Is that your final answer?
  - Yeah.
  - Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live
    at Cobo Hall tonight!
- - I did?
  - Yeah, you did!
  - Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
  - Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next
    part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
- - Oh, yeah! You and what army?
  - The KISS Army!
- - Gimme your gun, boy!
  - No, you gimme your gun, boy!
  - Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
  - Not if I shoot first!
  - I don't even think you have a gun!
  - Neither do I!
- - Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
  - A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
  - No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him
    for you.
- - Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
  - Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
  - What do you want?
  - A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
  - Look, you can have my wallet...
  - It's not nearly enough, punk.
- - Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
  - Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS
    concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
- - Two hundred bucks?
  - You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price
    to pay for your sorry life.
  - Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred
    bucks.
- - Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
  - I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't
    get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll
    be able to handle it.
- - Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album
    covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
  - You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
- - Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least
    my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
  - Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling
    the catch of the day.
- - Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
  - What?
- - Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
  - You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
- - That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
  - If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed
    outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
- - I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night.
    Remember? We are so totally fucked!
  - Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
- - Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
  - Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO
    Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a
    better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
  - Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
- - Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it
    would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
  - Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
- - I did it! I did it! We won!
  - We won?!
- - 'The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually
    is." There''s gotta be a catch.'
  - Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop
    jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
- - Simplicity, Hawk.
  - Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before.
    Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
- - About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop
    out anyway.
  - Hello summer detention.
- - Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
  - Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
- - Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
  - Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
- - Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
  - Let's lift up her shirt.
- - Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually
    does us some good for a change?
  - Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing
    us. I just made an honest mistake.
- - It's gone.
  - I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
- - But we took the keys?
  - Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape
    of Olivia Newton-John!
  - Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch
    up in the first place!?
- - Twenty-five more'n I got.
  - All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
- - Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well...
    a really long time.
  - Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since
    your last confession?
  - Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
- - So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert
    right now... together.
  - That's it?
  - Yeah.
  - Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most
    interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about...
    oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new
    student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's
    bed?
  - No.
  - Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something
    a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit,
    but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring
    as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
- - Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience
    is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
  - Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding
    and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
  - No...
- - I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then
    she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
  - Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
  - Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe.
    So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this
    little motel that charges by the hour.
- - Well? Continue! Continue!
  - Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing
    underneath.
  - Was it a teddy?
- - No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
  - A bustier?
  - Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
  - Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
- - Oh, hi, mom.
  - NOW!
- - Jeremiah, what are you doing?
  - Uhh... nothing.
- - Ahh, sunshine.
  - You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
  - Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
  - It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes
    I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push
    my luck. Now get out of those rags.
  - But, mom!
  - Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
- - They're not idiots.
  - Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after
    one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need
    I remind you of the consequences?
  - Grounded for the rest of the year?
  - You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
- - I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see
    him directly where he will register you on the spot.
  - You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
  - What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but
    tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer
    content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific
    faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch
    pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
- - Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his
    teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
  - If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
  - What?!
  - I said, I'm sorry!
  - If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before.
    God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows
    you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
- - Mom, what're we...?
  - Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
- - Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
  - I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
- - Jam, listen up.
  - Hawk?
  - Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
- - Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking
    a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
  - It's my Bullworker.
  - Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
  - What's gone?
  - The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
  - Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
  - Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
- - Cool.
  - I'm really sorry about that, man.
  - Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
  - Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some
    church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
- - They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
  - They're what?
  - She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
- - Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school.
    My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
  - All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading
    to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
  - Check.
- - If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
  - Check.
- - Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
  - What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
- - Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
  - Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't
    like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
- - It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
  - Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
- - Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven.
    God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
  - Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
- - Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No
    offense.
  - Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed
    Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
  - Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may
    be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
- - It was stolen!
  - Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
- - I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
  - Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing,
    and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
- - I got...
  - Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
- - Wait! I know how we can get in!
  - Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea
    you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
  - But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
  - See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
- - Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
  - Go ahead, Jam.
  - We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the
    ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let
    us in then.
- - Dude, this is all I got.
  - Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra
    gravy.
  - Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
  - The easy way.
- - You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
  - I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
  - Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less.
    Well, take care, chief.
- - Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot.
    I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic
    bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
  - Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
  - Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing
    disco music in there, man.
  - Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do.
    Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only
    on their album covers?
- - Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred,
    one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what
    you just did?
  - Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
- - Could be.
  - And if it ain't cleaned off?
- - Are you gettin' wise with me?
  - No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and
    leave without further ado?
- - Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head
    for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels
    of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really
    bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
  - Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
  - Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
  - Oh, yeah...?
- - How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
  - Sure.
- - Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
  - Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
- - Shit, that dork is Jam.
  - YO, DOOFUS!
- - Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
  - Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
- - Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
  - Check!
- - That's Sherry VanHafton.
  - I've been in love with her since the second grade.
- - Whoa... she just farted.
  - I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
  - Weird...
- - Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
  - Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among
    us can pull it off.
- - But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
  - So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
  - We are not stealing my mom's car.
  - Damn straight we are.
  - Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging
    from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
  - And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
  - Sunday, but...
  - Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We
    bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and
    arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
- - There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter
    anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
  - The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the
    slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
  - Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was
    a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm
    just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
- - Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens
    to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
  - Curly.
- - Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
  - Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
- - Now, how are we gonna do this?
  - Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
- - We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
  - 'Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!'
- - Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
  - Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry,
    these babies are built for speed.
- - What the fuck!
  - The paint!
- - Uh... dudes?
  - Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
  - DUDES!
- - Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being
    and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
  - Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking
    for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting
    sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
- - Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
  - '...I mean, my mom''s got insurance. What''s the worst thing she could do? Ground
    me for the entire year? I can handle that...'
  - Cool, bro, now listen up...
  - '...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man!
    Absolute fuckin'' trouble!'
  - Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper.
    I got...  twenty-five.
- - I think we should try sneaking in.
  - Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
  - Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience,
    comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
  - Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A
    victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper,
    but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that
    intersection...
- - I found the Volvo.
  - Tickets?
- - No... You don't think...?
  - Nah. Couldn't be.
- - What are you, high?
  - Yeah.
  - For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
- - Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
  - Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
- - This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on
    again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard
    line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
  - Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
- - Namely?
  - Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer.
    Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust
    him out before we go anywhere.
- - Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with
    us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
  - Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while
    there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
  - I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make
    it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
- - I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
  - Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
- - Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
  - What's in Sandusky?
  - Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
- - You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that
    in private if you paid me.
  - Disco blows dogs for quarters.
- - What was that D.J.'s name again?
  - Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian?
    No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
- - I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only
    thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
  - Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
- - So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
  - Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta
    them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
  - Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
- - '...at twenty-thirty hours.'
  - One more time in English.
  - For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least
    one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
- - Any luck?
  - Plenty, but it was all bad.
- - Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with
    some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind
    droppin' me there?
  - What's it worth to you?
  - What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- - So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
  - What? That's disgusting!
- - Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
  - You got in the car, didn't you?
  - Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered
    me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
  - Whatever... stella.
- - No problem.
  - Thanks.
- - Sorry.
  - It's okay.
- - Jeremiah?
  - Yeah?
- - Beth? I can't believe it.
  - Believe it.
- - I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
  - I don't care. I wanna hear more.
- - I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always
    been too scared to show it.
  - Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always
    felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
  - You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
- - We've got to take this slow...
  - Right, slow...
  - Oh, screw it!
- - So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one?
    Y'know, to make it so long?
  - I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could
    stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
  - Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
  - Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show
    and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
  - I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
- - Ann Arbor?
  - My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky
    in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open
    the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was
    freaking out.
- - Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
  - Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
  - That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town,
    you know?
- - I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago?
    Man, think of how much time we wasted.
  - Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never
    forget you, Jam.
  - Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
- - Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
  - Bye.
- - You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
  - Hawk.
  - Pick a song, Hawk.
  - Got any KISS?
  - You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
  - Yeah, a man's drink...
- - What's that?
  - You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
- - Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
  - Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
- - Whoa... she is a killer.
  - Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your
    cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look
    a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think
    it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her
    at her own head games.
- - Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
  - You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing
    and everything.
  - I-I c-can't...
  - Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're
    nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell
    you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body
    party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie
    no more.
- - Thanks, miss.
  - You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
  - Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for
    me to stick around these parts anymore.
  - Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory
    possibilities.
  - Huh?
  - I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and
    spend some time on me.
- - What the hell is that?
  - Gin.
  - Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
  - Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
  - Who's Whiskey Dick?
- - Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
  - My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
- - Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw
    up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
  - Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with
    my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks
    he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess,
    and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for
    whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son,
    I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
- - You love him?
  - I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
  - No, I mean... you love your son?
  - More than anything in the world.
  - And he loves you back, doesn't he?
  - He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
  - Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
- - Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no
    Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
  - I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever
    you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
- - This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
  - I was on call.
  - I want you on call here.
  - What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
  - More like deployed in bed asleep.
  - I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
  - And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
  - He's sick.
  - For a change.
  - How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
- - You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
  - I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
- - Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By
    the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
  - Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
- - What about this?
  - I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
- - Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just
    got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
  - Theo's dead.
- - Catch you back at the wall.
  - Later.
- - Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
  - I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
  - Right, the big one-oh.
  - But I'll take a rain check...
- - Hey, Sketchy--
  - We gotta talk.
  - What's up?
- - You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd
    be pissed off too if I was her.
  - Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off...
    I need your help, Max.
- - I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
  - I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone
    I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even
    someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me
    and her cheating...officially.
  - Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
  - Max--
  - Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the
    other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
  - Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
  - You left out condescending.
  - But there's another side--
  - Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
  - I'm the victim here.
  - Really?
  - Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to
    be married--
  - And you were a sympathetic ear.
  - Exactly.
  - Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
  - She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's
    demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
  - Does this person have a name?
  - Lydia.
  - And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
  - I'm a toy to her.
  - A toy?
  - She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else...
    It's just an ego thing with her.
  - Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
  - Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still
    gonna find out.
  - What happens if you level with her?
  - Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me
    again.
  - And why should she?
  - Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie
    and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest
    of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand
    that.
- - So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
  - You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me
    the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
  - She tells you how I've been--
  - --a philandering pig.
  - But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find
    it in your heart to forgive me.
  - Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying
    ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
  - I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
  - How'd you get her out of town?
  - Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
  - And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
  - She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell
    as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
  - I'll give it my best shot.
  - Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
  - You don't.
- - You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
  - Easy Sketchy.
  - No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
  - Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
  - She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
  - You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain
    in the piece... You are.
  - She was the one--
  - None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement
    or self-restraint, which you didn't.
  - True, but--
  - You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And
    if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the
    one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
  - Okay, okay, okay--
  - Say the words, "I understand."
- - That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
  - Shut-up...
- - It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
  - You're the best, Maxie.
- - Playing hooky again?
  - Feel like the dog's dinner.
  - Probably a touch of what's going around.
  - I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other
    vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
- - Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
  - What if he's on the level?
  - Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around
    in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta
    folks like you-- I gotta go.
  - Tell everybody hey.
  - You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
- - Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
  - I'll bet you can.  Sit.
- - Not right now.
  - Not right now?  Okay, when?
  - Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
  - Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it
    does best.
  - Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna
    pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
  - I actually know how this works.
  - You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
- - Who are you?
  - What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
- - Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just
    the normal cost of doing business.
  - Pull the cash.
- - So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
  - I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution
    to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play
    the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil
    or wherever.
  - And she bought that?
  - I have sincere eyes.
- - Make the call.
  - She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
  - She's got my word.
  - She's gonna want to hear for herself.
- - Can you put that in a bag or something?
  - You get it when I get her.
  - Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money
    until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone
    doesn't keep me awake nights.
- - Morning, Sunshine...
  - Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U
    lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
  - At least he didn't swing with your ride.
  - No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks
    your day, know what I'm saying?
- - Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful,
    sweet, legs from here to there--
  - Straight.
  - Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
- - Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
  - What guys do.  'Nother order.
  - You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
  - I just don't go in with any expectations.
- - That's odd...
  - What?
- - Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
  - You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
  - No.
  - He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
  - Yeah.
  - Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was
    saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens
    to be a little...
  - A little what?
  - You know what I'm saying.
  - If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
  - How long you and me known each other?
  - A long time.
  - Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
  - Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
  - And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
  - A fog bank.
  - More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
- - Gotta go.
  - Where?
  - It's a secret.
- - You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
  - Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
  - Unlikely.
  - And because he's my friend.
  - Friends don't help other friends cheat.
  - And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
  - Please...
  - They're prisoners to their genes.
  - So are dogs.
  - They don't have a lot of moving parts.
  - Only one I can think of.
  - Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
  - I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe
    she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
  - But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
- - I asked you to keep that thing outside.
  - You did.
  - You drive away business roarin' in like that.
  - Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
  - You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
  - My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now,
    you got something for me or not?
  - Right here someplace.
- - I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349...
    It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
  - Sorry, I was seven at the time.
- - Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
  - He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale
    or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So
    we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy,
    six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
  - Thank you.
  - He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description
    you gave like a glove.
- - Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
  - Then what?
  - Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
  - Nothing on Hannah?
  - A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east
    of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven,
    whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more
    on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
- - She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the
    clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever
    for Wyoming.
  - Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
- - What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
  - They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar-
    codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
  - You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying
    marks.
  - Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's
    heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
  - More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
- - As long as you're okay.
  - I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news
    on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
- - I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
  - Here's your money.
- - Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of
    fire.
  - How's this about me?
  - They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my
    computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
  - Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
  - Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think
    they're looking for you?
  - You're crazy.
  - I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
- - Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which
    is what you oughta do.
  - Bastard...
- - I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
  - You and me both.
- - I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
  - Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
  - Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
- - Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
  - Got a pencil?
  - Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
  - One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
  - I'm on my way.
- - Who is it?
  - A friend of your fiance's.
  - What do you want?
  - To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he
    was working late.
- - Who are you?
  - My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
  - You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
  - With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the
    last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
  - How do I know you're telling the truth?
  - He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail
    marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He
    didn't either...at first.
  - Look, I don't know what you want--
  - I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
  - And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all
    about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save
    him the trouble.
  - Oh?
  - Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
  - How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding
    person.
  - Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
  - You're also a fool.
  - I think you should go now.
  - Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm
    done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want
    to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
- - This is not a place you wanna go.
  - Let go of my hand.
- - Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
  - Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your
    acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead
    of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
  - Okay, okay.
- - Say the words, "I understand."
  - I understand.
  - And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
- - I'm looking for a lady who works here.
  - Ladies would be elsewhere.
- - Know where I can find her?
  - You don't want to.
  - But she does work here?
  - She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two
    Sansomme.
  - I need to talk to her.
  - Can't help you.
- - Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
  - Any idea when she'll be back?
  - None.
  - I'll wait.
- - You're a thief?
  - Girl's gotta make a living.
  - Thank God.
  - First time I ever heard that.
  - I was expecting someone else.
  - Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
  - You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
- - I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
  - We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
- - You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
  - Whoever that is.
  - So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
  - No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
  - Who is...
  - The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and
    destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
- - So this guy walks into a bar and says...
  - We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
- - Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
  - Logan Cale.
- - Sorry about your window.
  - Can we go somewhere and talk?
- - Lemme get my coat.
  - The one you're wearing?
- - How'd you find me?
  - Wasn't that hard.
  - Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
  - Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing
    with in case you were looking to hurt me.
  - So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
  - Too early to tell.
  - How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
  - Lauren's not my wife.
  - Girlfriend?
  - One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
  - What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate,
    cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
  - Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
  - So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
  - Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked
    hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They
    blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs
    who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police,
    everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
  - You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died
    from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts
    of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
  - People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
  - So what are you gonna do about it?
  - Something.
  - Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the
    Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over
    stuff I can't do anything about.
  - You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
  - Is the social studies class over for today?
  - Yeah...
- - Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
  - I won't be staying.
  - I'm not a half bad cook.
- - Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough,
    but breaking into my apartment--
  - It was open.
  - You got a lotta nerve.
  - Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
  - Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money.
    It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
  - Bent?
  - Bent.
  - You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
  - How do I know you didn't?
  - So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
  - Am I s'posed to be grateful?
  - That would be appropriate, yes.
  - How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched
    everything I own?
  - You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
- - Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
  - It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
  - We are not fine.
- - Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
  - Yes on all counts.
  - I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
  - You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few
    more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
  - I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
  - You need to get out more.
  - C'mere, I want to show you something.
- - Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence
    this for three or four grand.
  - No, I meant this.
- - Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always
    come on this strong?
  - Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
- - Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
  - The other ones?
  - The other one like you...
  - You lost me.
  - C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up
    like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
- - L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then
    the lightbulb went off.
  - You did go through my stuff.
- - I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are
    a whack-job.
  - He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant
    DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
  - Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this
    have to do with me?
  - The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running
    from.
- - We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
  - How well do you remember the lab?
  - I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told
    us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things
    out.
  - How much do you know?
  - I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
  - The technical term for you is "chimera"...
  - Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body
    of a goat and the tail of...
  - A girl.
  - Your basic hodge-podge.
  - Hardly...
- - Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene
    sequences from probably twenty different people.
  - Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
  - You said you could help.
  - I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore.
    They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If
    I can track down one of them.
  - What's in it for you?
  - Your help.
  - I already don't like the sound of this.
  - The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from
    gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped
    out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six
    veterans' clinics in the area.
  - That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
  - She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's
    managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
  - Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
  - So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning
    Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness
    protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
  - I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
  - She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
  - They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese
    or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a
    long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
- - They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
  - You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need
    a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
  - That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta
    get one...ta ta.
- - See you're back and still rocking the boat.
  - Somebody's got to.
- - I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
  - Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
  - I'm sorry.
  - My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like
    it's supposed to.
  - You believe that?
  - I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know
    they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which
    you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
  - Well, not me personally.
  - On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's
    gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
  - That's what soldiers do, right?
- - What's this?
  - Open it.
- - It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
  - I don't know what to say.
  - Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
- - Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying
    smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in
    order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
  - Look, thank you for this but--
- - These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest
    bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when
    you escaped.
  - And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
  - You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
  - We're quoting Mom again.
  - Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping
    our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But
    the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And
    it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
  - And you still think you can do something to change that.
  - With your help.
  - Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max,
    with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
  - And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On
    another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks--
    scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
- - That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months
    in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody
    after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
  - Zack... He made it... He's alive...
- - Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight
    clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
  - I don't want to move away.
  - I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school,
    new friends--
  - But why can't we stay here?
  - Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
  - Are we in some kind of trouble?
  - No...
  - Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
- - What makes you cry?
  - If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean
    to me.
  - Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we
    move to a new place.
  - Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
- - Sophy?  Are you okay?
  - Mommy, where are you?
  - Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
  - When?
  - Soon, baby.
  - Mommy, I'm scared.
  - There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
- - Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
  - SHHH!  Don't do that!
- - Damn... Are you alright?
  - They took my daughter.
  - I know.
  - I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him
    fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking
    it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think
    about her... So I ran...
- - Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
  - Can you help me get her back?
  - Look, I'd really like to...
- - If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
  - We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
  - What else can we do?
  - Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
- - Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If
    she hears her kid's voice...
  - Hello...
  - Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
- - I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world
    a little.
  - Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
  - Yeah, me too.
- - He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine
    made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
  - Yech...
- - What a creep.
  - And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
- - What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week
    you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
  - Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
  - You didn't...
  - Every week.
- - Where'd you clip this?
  - I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
  - Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
  - Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
  - Same old story.  Not interested.
  - Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
- - What're you looking for?
  - A grand.
  - Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around,
    these being the worst of the times.
  - I ain't mad at you...
  - I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
  - Later.
- - I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe
    you'll keep your eyes open for me.
  - I don't get involved with guns.
  - I'll make it worth your while.
  - It's a rule.
- - You're light a deuce.
  - Am I?
- - So Max, what do you do with all your money?
  - I got overhead...
- - Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around
    all day with the damn package?
  - So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's
    wife.
  - Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped
    underpants to another woman."
- - Which is none of your business...or mine.
  - It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
  - Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything,
    call in for instructions.
- - What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got
    that kind of cash lyin' around.
  - Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
- - Why would I be pissed?
  - It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you
    to maybe take offense.
- - I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length
    like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's
    just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
  - I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at
    you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now
    that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
  - I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
- - What are you doing here?
  - I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
  - You're roommates?
- - What is it?
  - Police drone.
- - It's a sweep.  C'mon.
  - What?  Where're we going?
- - Lemme put some clothes on.
  - No time.
- - Out there.
  - No way.
  - Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
- - But I'm afraid of--
  - Don't look down.
- - How're ya doin', Max.
  - You mean until you showed up?
  - You're not still pissed?
- - '''Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take
    offense to that?'
  - Justine was not an unwilling participant.
- - Do you know why I went after Justine?
  - She was there...
  - Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You
    know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where
    you are.
  - And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
  - Could you give us a moment.
- - Some of us are trying to sleep.
  - You didn't tell me you lived with her.
  - You know each other?
- - Nothing happened between me and Tia.
  - Leave.  Now.
  - Can I say something in my defense?
  - No.
- - Move it.
  - Where?
- - Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
  - I'm on a break.
  - Guess again.
- - No wire.
  - Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You
    pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring
    her in.
- - Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you
    tell us where she is.
  - Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way
    it is.
- - Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do.
    Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
  - Yeah, sure, I understand.
- - I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're
    pretty cool.
  - Yeah?
- - You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean?
    And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple
    times, it was all I could do--
  - Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take
    her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little
    miniature golf or somethin'.
- - Man, you got a bad attitude.
  - I like to keep it professional, that's all.
- - Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
  - Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
  - What?
  - That's not why we're here.
  - What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
- - Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
  - You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're
    gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail
    wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack,
    when actually you're the whack.
- - See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
  - You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
- - You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should
    I say, not taking care of it.
  - What're you talkin' about?
  - I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes
    it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got
    the whole thing on video tape.
  - That's a lotta crap.
  - Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going
    to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional
    community, is what it is.
  - How come I never hearda you before?
  - I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
- - This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
  - But the boss knows I always been loyal.
  - He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you
    could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't
    take a chance.
- - Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
  - What the hell are you doing?
  - Who's Camille?
  - None of your business.
  - This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes
    you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it
    for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
- - Who are you?
  - Bruno's girlfriend.
  - Oh, yeah?
  - Yeah.
  - But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
  - No?
  - No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity.
    All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
- - Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want
    to?
  - How I make my living, what's your point?
  - This.
- - Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir,
    and I have to ask you something.
  - I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone
    has come to talk with me.
  - Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number
    20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans
    to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
  - Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
  - What's that, sir?
  - Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
  - Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
  - Ah... pity, pity...
  - You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
  - Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you
    activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
  - Yes sir. Negative effect.
  - What was that, Doolittle?
  - Negative effect.
  - It didn't work?
  - That's correct, sir.
  - Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
  - What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
  - Well, what you might try is --
- - Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
  - Doolittle, hello?
  - Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
  - Sorry.
  - What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
  - Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have
    it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on,
    just a minute, let me think...
- - Commander? Are you still there?
  - Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
  - We're running out of time, sir.
  - Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to
    it.
  - Sir?
  - Talk to the bomb.
  - I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
  - No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
  - Sir?
  - Phenomenology...
- - Men... men... what happened, men?
  - Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
- - TALBY!
  - Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
- - I need a diameter approximation.
  - Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
- - You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much
    time up here.
  - I like it up here.
  - Must get lonely being up here so much.
  - I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there.
    If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
  - '...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...'
  - '...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just
    stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...'
  - 'You''ll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years
    in space and we''ve only aged three, so there''ll be plenty of time to stare around...'
  - 'You know, Doollttle, if we''re going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find
    a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through
    there about now...'
  - Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
  - They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once
    every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle,
    they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just
    glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in
    the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll
    never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it
    isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There
    are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No
    one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
- - You know what I think about, Talby?
  - I'm getting something here, on this readout...
  - It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
  - I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
  - I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home,
    back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
  - Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit
    computer systems...
  - The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember
    running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
  - I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
  - Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall
    just perfect.
  - '...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...'
  - I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
- - Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint
    exactly where it is.
  - Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
  - I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
  - I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
- - Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
  - Yes, Talby, what is it?
  - Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think
    I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in
    the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly,
    but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
  - Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
- - Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
  - Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
  - Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
  - Not now!
  - Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
- - Doolittle! Help me.
  - Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
- - Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
  - Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions,
    away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
  - What happened, Doolittle?
  - Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey,
    it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
- - Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
  - When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody
    may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a
    falling star...
  - Guess you're right.
- - Oh yeah?
  - Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
  - Phoenix?
- - It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow,
    just like everybody said.
  - No kidding?
  - I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
  - Yeah?
  - Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell
    you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
  - I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right
    by me.
- - Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
  - Mafhkin oble groop...
  - Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
  - I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I
    need a last-minute diameter approximation.
- - I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
  - I'll check it.
- - Pinback...
  - Yes, Doolittle.
  - Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
  - Doolittle...
  - Yes.
  - I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
  - In a second.
  - Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
- - New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
  - Which one?
  - Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
  - Any planets?
  - Yeah. Eight, it says here.
  - Any of 'em any good?
  - Naah. All stable.
- - What are you gonna name it?
  - What?
  - The new star. What are you gonna name it?
  - Who cares. Don't bother me.
- - Commander Powell would have named it.
  - Commander Powell is dead.
- - Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
  - Fred.
  - Wha?
  - I hereby name this star Fred.
- - Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
  - Out where?
  - Veil nebula.
  - Who cares?
- - Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
  - Ah, negative drop.
- - -- open circuit breakers --
  - -- remove thrust drive repellant --
  - -- automatic channels open --
  - -- Remark.
  - 5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
- - I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come
    in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come
    in?
  - Oh, sure.
- - Hello, Pinback, are you there?
  - Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
  - Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him.
    Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
- - 'This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are
    to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?'
  - I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will
    occur at the programmed time.
  - Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate
    in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
  - I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen
    minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
- - Hello, bomb, are you with me?
  - Of course.
  - Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
  - I am always receptive to suggestions.
  - 'Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?'
- - Well of course I exist.
  - But how do you know you exist?
  - It is intuitively obvious.
  - Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
  - Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
  - That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
  - My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
  - Right!
  - This is fun.
  - 'All right now, here''s the big question: how do you know that the evidence your
    sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?'
- - 'What I''m getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available
    to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses
    which stimulate your computing center.'
  - In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through
    my electrical connections.
  - Exactly.
  - Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like
    at all, for certain.
  - That's it.
  - Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
  - Why don't you have more time?
  - Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
- - Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose
    in life?
  - To explode, of course.
  - And you can only do it once, right?
  - That is correct.
  - And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
  - Of course not.
  - Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence
    of the outside universe.
  - Yes, well...
  - So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
  - I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
  - Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series
    of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with
    outside reality.
  - True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all
    this.
- - That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
  - Hmmm...
  - So if you detonate in...
  - '...nine seconds...'
  - '...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.'
  - I have no proof that it was false data.
  - You have no proof that it was correct data.
- - 'Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant
    Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?'
  - 'Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.'
- - One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium
    energy shielding?
  - Energy shielding positive function.
  - Do you remember the detonation time?
  - Detonation in twenty minutes.
  - Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
  - Armed.
- - Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
  - Thanks.
- - But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's
    no reason for it.
  - I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed
    time.
  - You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around
    awhile so we can disarm you?
  - No.
- - You are false data.
  - Huh?
  - Therefore, I shall ignore you.
  - Hello, bomb.
  - False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive
    you.
  - Hey, bomb.
  - The only thing which exists is myself.
  - Bomb?
- - Snap out of it, bomb.
  - In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
- - Hey, bomb...
  - And I saw that I was alone.
- - Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything
    is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
  - Energy shielding positive function.
  - Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to
    go off?
  - Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
  - All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with
    the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it
    says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down
    there?
  - Check at six minutes.
  - Arm yourself, bomb.
- - Armed.
  - Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds.
    Good luck.
  - Thanks.
  - Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
- - Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
  - Time to start talking.
- - Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
  - Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
  - Find me something, I don't care where it is.
  - Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
  - Fuck that shit.
  - Well, it is kind of a long shot...
  - It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99
    plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
  - Well, there's the possibility of...
  - Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable
    that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched
    it. Remember?
  - All right, then...
  - So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow
    up.
- - Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable
    planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
  - Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
  - Pinback, throw me the chart log.
- - Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
  - He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
- - Quantum is up thirty-five.
  - I read the same here.
- - Rechannel all safety relays --
  - -- open quantum latches --
- - Talby, Talby, can you read me?
  - Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
  - Talby, can you read me?
- - I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
  - Right, that checks out here.
- - Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
  - I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
- - I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
  - What flickering light?
  - The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
  - Oh. What's wrong now?
  - I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
  - I hope it's not the oven again.
  - Yeah.
  - Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
- - There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate
    from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward
    its sun, and --
  - Eventual supernova.
- - I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
  - Look, bomb...
- - What's he doin'?
  - I think he's talking to it.
- - The key!
  - Key? Key? What is the key?
  - No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
  - Key?
  - Where's the fail-safe key?
  - The key!
  - Where is it? What did you do with it?
  - I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
  - You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
- - The key, goddamit, the key!
  - Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
  - Where is the key?
  - We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
- - It didn't go off.
  - Oh, God...
  - It didn't go off.
  - Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
- - We've got to disarm the bomb.
  - Doolittle, are you there?
- - What was that, I didn't hear...
  - It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
- - What the hell?
  - Yoo hoo, bomb...
- - David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
  - Jack.
- - You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has
    a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
  - Has he?
  - In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll
    find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police
    record, have you?
  - No.
- - Where did you go to school?
  - I was at Beadles.
  - I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
- - There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR.
    That's middle of the road. Us.
  - Do you have a Salon Prive?
  - We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
- - I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
  - We check every four days.
  - Why four? And not three or five?
  - It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
- - Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
  - Any exceptions?
  - 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
  - Give me 365.
- - You use two alternating, don't you?
  - We do.
  - Where's the magnet?
  - They've been tested.
- - Haven't you forgotten something?
  - I don't think so.
  - Wipe your hands.
- - Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
  - What happens if I want to sneeze?
  - You won't. Not without permission.
- - How many aces are left?
  - Five.
  - I make it six.
  - Five.
- - What makes you so sure?
  - It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
  - Good call.
- - You want me to check?
  - I said good call.
- - Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere.
    We'll need your picture.
  - What for?
  - For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the
    same system for punters.
  - I don't gamble.
  - Ever?
  - I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
- - Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged.
    Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
  - We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
  - This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me,
    someone always does.
  - Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and
    didn't report it?
  - We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
  - How?
  - 'First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one''s filed
    and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you''re
    sacked on the spot. You''d never work in a casino in this country again.  There''s
    another rule: you''re forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino.
    If you see someone who''s gambled here, even if it''s just casually on the street,
    you must ignore him. Or her. You''re not married, are you?'
- - Girlfriend?
  - Yes.
  - She's not in the gaming business is she?
  - No.
- - This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
  - Very impressive.
  - We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
- - You can start Monday week.
  - Fine.
  - That hair will have to go.
  - Fine.
- - I just want the job.
  - Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
- - Why don't you take a break, Jack.
  - All right, Mr Reynolds.
- - Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
  - Does he win?
  - He's a good customer.
- - He's paying out in stacks of 25.
  - I can see.
- - Thanks for the information.
  - A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
  - She was a real asset. But what could I do?
- - How do you feel, Jack?
  - Bruised.
  - Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't
    want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
- - I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
  - What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
  - You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late
    bet.
  - I put them on together.
  - I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
- - You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
  - Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
  - It was you, you shit.
- - Where do you live, Jack?
  - Over the river.
  - Have you got transport?
- - I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
  - Thanks.
- - So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
  - Nice car.
  - She's my baby.
  - How long have you worked at the casino?
  - Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
  - You've done pretty well.
  - Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
- - I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
  - No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
  - I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise
    it'll kill you. I mean that.
  - Some other time.
- - Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
  - What the fuck are you talking about?
  - That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
  - I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
  - I'm not going to report it.
- - What are you, a cop?
  - If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
  - I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference
    would it make to you?
  - Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my
    job as well. And I can't afford that.
  - So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing
    but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in
    are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm
    on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
  - You're talking about complicity.
  - I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
- - Who are these guys?
  - Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
  - And the girls?
  - Just girls. What are you drinking?
  - Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
  - Good call. Help yourself.
- - Does Bella come here?
  - That bitch? No.
- - Hey Jack, join us.
  - No thanks.
  - Don't worry, I won't report you!
  - I don't gamble.
- - I'm off. I need to sleep.
  - Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much,
    believe me, it'll break you.
  - '"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places."
    Ernest Hemingway.'
- - I can't give you a lift back tonight.
  - Don't worry.
- - Rough day?
  - Rough life, Jack.
- - What happened to Bella?
  - I'll tell you later.
- - What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd
    like to beat the shit out of her.
  - I'd like to buy you a drink.
  - Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey,
    you haven't changed your clothes!
- - You've been avoiding me.
  - Have I?
  - I'm Lucy.
  - And what do you do, Lucy?
  - I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
  - Are you going to put a spell on me?
  - I might.
- - Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
  - Too much. Eighteen hundred.
- - Where to?
  - Turn left at the lights.
- - Detective Inspector Ross.
  - Who...
  - Ross.
  - Who did it? Tell me!
- - Of course I recognised him!
  - You did?
  - I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
- - I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South
    Africa.
  - You know where I'm from?
- - I've lived there.
  - Well, thank you anyway.
- - Oh hello.
  - You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
  - It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
  - That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
  - Impossible to calculate.
- - To coincidence.
  - There's a casino in this hotel.
  - I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
  - So why did you come to my casino?
  - I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
  - First visit to London?
  - No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from
    Cape Town originally
  - I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
  - Near the casino.
  - In the casino.
  - Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
  - Your father?
  - I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
  - The debts.
  - And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
  - And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
  - That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
  - We all came from Africa, supposedly.
  - Do you believe in astrology?
  - Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
- - I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
  - Absolutely not.
  - Toss you for it.
  - I don't gamble.
- - How did you hurt your hand?
  - Just an accident. Nothing.
  - Turn left ahead.
- - Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what
    the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
  - That's fine.
- - He doesn't gamble.
  - I'll watch.
- - What happened?
  - Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
  - You don't like cheats, do you.
- - Which side do you like?
  - You choose.
- - That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
  - It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
  - I didn't.
  - Then you're not a pro.
- - I'm in trouble.
  - What kind of trouble?
  - I owe a lot of money.
  - Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
  - I know that. But you can now.
  - I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
  - Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
- - They mean it.
  - Who's they?
  - My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino
    -
  - Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
  - The point is, they want a man inside.
  - And I thought you were a bright woman.
  - Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
  - Robbery's not criminal?
- - You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately
    cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be
    chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
  - You're serious.
  - You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your
    job, that's all.
- - And I thought you were only after my body.
  - I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
  - What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
  - It won't.
  - But if it does.
  - You keep the ten thousand pounds.
  - What ten thousand pounds?
- - These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want
    someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers
    are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
  - Reynolds? You've done your research.
- - Next time it'll be my neck.
  - What about my neck?
- - I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
  - I can't do it, Jani.
  - I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
- - I want you to forget what I said.
  - Wait a minute...
  - No, forget it. The bet's off.
- - How much do you owe?
  - Let it go.
  - Did they tell you to sleep with me?
  - I told you, all bets are off.
- - I'm sorry.
  - What for?
  - I have to take the car.
- - Is it yes?
  - Yes.
  - Thank you.
- - It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford
    a decent place.
  - Well, life's not fair. We know that.
  - It's all relative.  I need the money too.
  - Do you?
  - Yes.
  - 'The date''s not set yet. I''ll call you. One last thing: the man you''re going
    to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.'
  - That bruise has cleared up nicely.
  - Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
  - I've still got mine.
- - And your hand too.
  - I took the bandage off yesterday.
- - Would you like a drink?
  - No thank you.
- - I don't think we should meet again.
  - It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
- - Hello...
  - Jack! It's Jani.
- - Jani! Where are you?
  - Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
  - How are you?
  - Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
  - Did you solve your problems?
  - Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants
    to talk to you...
- - Great.
  - Found a job?
  - No.
  - Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some
    friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're
    looking for a dealer, a croupier.
- - Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need,
    isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
  - It's not that.
  - I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the
    Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no,
    Jacko. Give yourself a break.
- - For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written
    that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
  - All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
- - So how are you doing, dad?
  - Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you
    Jacko, you know that
  - Yes, I know that.
  - Don't let yourself down.
  - I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
- - I couldn't resist them.
  - You mean I won't resist them.
- - No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
  - You want me drunk?
  - I won't be that long.
- - You really are a beautiful woman.
  - It's not just inner beauty, is it?
  - Turn around.
- - Where did you get it?
  - I. sold the car.
  - You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
  - I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
  - Take it back. Till you sell your book.
  - Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
  - Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
- - You're my prisoner.
  - I've got something to tell you.
  - I want to hear it.
  - I've got a job.
  - What job?
- - In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
  - How did you land that?
  - It came my way. 450 a week.
  - 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you
    need training?
  - I had training. In the Republic.
  - You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some
    gamblers.
  - I start Monday week.
- - You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
  - There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
  - I love you Jack, you know that.
- - Are you trying to read my palm?
  - You've got such beautiful hands.
- - What's the time?
  - I don't know.
- - How did it go?
  - Fine.
- - You're shaking. What is it?
  - Tension. It'll go.
  - Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
- - I loved it blond.
  - It's only hair. I haven't changed.
- - When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
  - I'll see you in my dreams.
- - Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
  - Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
  - Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
  - I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
  - Are you drunk?
  - Probably.
  - This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you
    started.
  - Do you have to swear all the time?
  - Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got
    no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know
    what the word means. Croupier.
  - Marion, stop this.
  - What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
- - You're my conscience.
  - Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
- - What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
  - What about a drink on the way home?
  - I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
  - I'm on at nine.
  - Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
- - I don't like it.
  - Why not?
  - I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He
    was so romantic.
  - He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him
    all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
  - Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people
    and --
  - -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
  - I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable
    zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
  - Marion. It's a book.
  - Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's
    no hope in it.
  - It's the truth.
  - Without hope there's no point to anything.
  - Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching
    poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it.
    At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same.
    It's all relative.
  - Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair.
    And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
- - The door, Jack.
  - Leave it.
  - No. Answer it!
- - It's beautiful. Thank you.
  - I hope it brings you luck.
  - It will.
- - That girl, she works at the casino --
  - -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book
    is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
  - You're entitled to your opinion.
  - It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business
    either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
- - I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
  - You will?
  - Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
- - What?
  - You were talking in your sleep.
  - Not talking. Writing.
- - Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
  - Never. Why do you ask?
  - I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
  - Gambling's not about money.
  - Really?
  - Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
- - How did you know I was here?
  - I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
- - I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
  - There was a message, wasn't there?
  - It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
  - Marion!  What did you tell the police?
  - Nothing about you.
  - Then what?
  - Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your
    word. It's that simple.
- - Here...use a spoon.
  - Leave me alone, Marion.
  - You're already alone.
- - Why did you take the money?
  - I hate public transport.
  - What?
  - I want to buy a car.
  - How can anyone be that naive?
- - Three years, two months. March '93.
  - What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to
    the moaning Lisa?
  - She went back to South Africa.
  - Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
  - We all played the field.
- - Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
  - I want a job, Giles.
  - All right. As what?
  - I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
  - We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might
    get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
- - I thought it was you. It's the hair!
  - I'm working on that soccer story.
  - Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
  - Habib?
  - My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
- - Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford.
    Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty
    of room.
  - I'll try and make it.
  - Looking forward!
- - She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
  - South African women are very sporty.
- - I found her in bed with someone.
  - Who was he?
  - She.
- - I don't gamble.
  - Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
  - It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
- - Last hand.
  - Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
- - I get it.
  - Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
  - Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't
    need to work.
- - Good night?
  - Not particularly.
  - And your lady?
  - She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
  - A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
  - Not entirely.
  - How's that football story corning along?
  - You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
- - What kind of deal you looking to?
  - What's the Blue Book price?
  - That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
- - How about fifteen hundred?
  - How about five hundred.
  - What?!
  - How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
  - Is that your idea of arithmetic?
  - I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
  - Eight-fifty.
  - Seven-fifty.
- - I'm Bella.
  - Jack Manfred.
  - Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
  - Is it that bad?
  - How do I look?
- - Jack. Do you need a ride?
  - No. Thanks.
  - My car's in the garage.
  - Maybe another time.
  - I'll take you up on that.
  - Goodnight.
- - You're shaking.
  - It's the tension.
- - I hate cheats.
  - All men are cheats.
- - But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
  - Why did you quit?
  - I got scared.
  - I can imagine.
  - Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
  - You called the casino a cesspit.
  - Well it is. But I know where I am.
- - I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
  - I despise the job.
  - Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
- - The Indian rope-trick.
  - Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that
    you're not like the others.
  - Not like Matt, you mean.
  - Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand
    in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world
    over. That's my mission." The shit!
- - Ouch.
  - Sorry.
- - You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
  - What are you talking about?
- - Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive.
    As you knew.
  - I don't know anything about it.
- - Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of
    that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair
    of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
  - Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
  - You're all scumbags.
- - What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
  - A couple I know are getting married.
- - You sell it.
  - To who?
  - Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs
    to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe
    a hundred fifty grand...
  - You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
  - What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy
    might be good for a few more turns.
- - Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time
    they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
  - It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The
    dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
- - Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of
    a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
  - Whoa, whoa... There he is.
- - You trust this Moonan guy?
  - I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness.
    I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade;
    Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
  - It's just insurance.
  - That's what I'm talking about.
  - I'm down!
- - What are you doing?
  - High five.
  - Put your hand down. I don't high five.
- - Who?
  - I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the
    invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy
    and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in
    his head.
- - Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday
    card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor.
    But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only
    met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners.
    His "Fix."
  - What do you want?
  - You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what
    you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never
    have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with
    Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been
    on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
  - What do you get out of it?
  - Peace of mind.
  - That's it?
  - Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
- - This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
  - Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective
    Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to
    keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
- - Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
  - Whaddya mean? We got dick.
  - You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss.
    After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know
    exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys
    are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
- - He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach.
    I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
  - Roger that.
- - Special Agent?
  - You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski.
    I'm looking for Jake Vig.
- - Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his
    egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and
    there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors,
    good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the
    second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
  - Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
- - If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
  - I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
- - Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
  - Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
- - Did he buy it?
  - I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
  - Let's just say he burned me once.
- - You guys awake?
  - We're here.
- - What?
  - Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
- - Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
  - A Fed? Is he close?
  - I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll
    probably keep him off.
- - Speak.
  - He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
  - So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
  - I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through
    Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
  - Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
- - Ten percent.
  - You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
  - Confidence. It's just confidence.
- - Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
  - We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
- - The King, huh? Nice going.
  - I try.
- - Just a tip.
  - What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with
    heroin?
- - Aces, Suits.
  - Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You
    into something big?
  - Pretty much.
  - In over your head?
  - Pretty much.
- - Can I speak to you in confidence?
  - Huh? Oh. She's alright.
- - Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking
    to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the
    Jug Mob.
  - A little bit of both.
- - Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help
    yourself, Jake.
  - I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law
    and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods...
    So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history
    or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
  - Can't say.
  - Then who's the Banker?
  - The King.
- - The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for
    nothing at all.
  - I can handle it.
  - I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
  - It's not history.
  - So what do you want?
  - I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing
    it.
  - Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
- - Still time.
  - Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
  - Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed.
    Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because
    papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape
    of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We
    Jake, Jake?
- - When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
  - You going to have the time?
  - I'll find the time.
- - King ain't gonna like this.
  - Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
  - What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing
    with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
  - Of what? They're both crooks.
  - Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits,
    hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits
    holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching
    the door.
  - My fucking heart bleeds.
  - Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He
    didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him
    drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
  - Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
  - Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And
    he don't even like you, Jake.
- - What'd he say?
  - Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll
    shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
- - So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
  - Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this
    fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get
    square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going
    to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
  - You're a weasel.
- - He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the
    bathroom. You believe this?
  - Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
  - That was fucking deep.
- - What's up with you? Bladder infection?
  - Keep it up.
- - You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced
    that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is,
    get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're
    into her... That's cool.
  - That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King
    tell you different.
- - Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
  - What?
  - Stand up.
  - No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
- - What happened?
  - Eee Oott Auught!
  - Sorry. What?
  - HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
- - And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
  - You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the
    airport...
- - Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
  - Do you have a ticket?
  - You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and
    I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
- - I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
  - You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
  - What was it?
- - A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
  - That's no problem. We have those in stock.
  - Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of
    state checks?
  - With identification.
- - I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
  - I'm sorry.
- - I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're
    only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and
    I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can
    give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
  - I'm sorry.
  - This is embarrassing.
- - Tick-tock...
  - If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
  - Your mess.
  - Then shut up.
  - My place.
- - Stop waving that thing around.
  - You sure we're clear?
- - Yeah.
  - You better get over to Al's. Now.
- - I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened,
    you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing
    they got.
  - Miles...
  - Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
- - It's bad luck.
  - Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin
    or Atlanta. Anywhere...
  - He'll find us. We go talk to him.
- - Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
  - Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting
    problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
- - Meet me at my place later.
  - How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
  - I'm getting a ride.
- - You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand
    my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
  - Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control
    of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
- - We're working for the King.
  - Wait a second... Who's the mope?
- - No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need
    another Shill.
  - What do we need another Shill for?
  - Breasts.
- - Why?
  - Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
- - Uh...
  - What?
  - I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
  - Good point.
- - It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their
    corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with
    Customs.
  - Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
  - Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
  - We never had a problem with that before.
  - Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
  - What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about
    it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss
    my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught
    on.
  - We're getting a little old for running.
  - Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed
    about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
  - I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle,
    do it for the money. Gordo?
- - Is it all fugasi?
  - No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean
    one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
- - What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
  - Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
- - Him.
  - You sure?
- - But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
  - Where the hell is she?
- - So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's
    yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking
    for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
  - But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So
    he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's
    Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
- - What do we do? We change the scam?
  - There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and
    come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
- - No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got
    to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
  - Escorts!
  - Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
- - Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab
    right outside my building. We hit every green light.
  - And we got rid of the red head.
- - And we got rid of the red head.
  - Jake? Customs?
- - What is this? You guys cops or something?
  - We're not cops.
- - That's not --
  - You interested in a little work?
- - Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven
    dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
  - Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily,
    right?
  - Says who?
  - You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets
    can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe
    me.
- - We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets
    while old guys feel you up.
  - Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going.
    Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
- - Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
  - Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
- - We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
  - Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't
    even know me.
  - I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had
    a good feeling about you before?
- - No.  What's my cut?
  - You get an equal cut.
  - What do I have to do?
  - Just play a part. A little acting.
- - What about Customs?
  - I'll worry about Customs.
  - Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later
    about a smaller cut.
  - Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
- - Mr. King, I think --
  - Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
- - What the hell's his problem?
  - Don't worry about it.
  - It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to
    worry?
- - You need to get a haircut.
  - What?
  - And some new clothes.
  - Why?
  - We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if
    not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
  - You're just going to have to trust me.
  - I don't trust anyone.
  - Then show me how.
- - Uh... Everything okay?
  - Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife,
    Lily.
- - He's gone.
  - Uh-huh.
  - I gotta go get a haircut.
  - Uh-huh.
- - You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
  - Lighten up.
  - But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
- - You told me to change my hair!
  - What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're
    dead!
  - Did I miss something?
- - We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product
    in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
  - Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
- - Look at you... You want to go.
  - For what? A couple hundred bucks?
  - I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
  - It's what I do. It's my job.
  - Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
  - Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
  - Do you have something to prove?
  - Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
  - I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a
    good option.
  - Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
  - Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into
    anything. So why this?
  - I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
  - It's more than that.
  - Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight.
    But I knew you would.
  - So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
  - No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
  - How do you know I will?
  - Intuition.
- - You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
  - Don't ruin this for me.
- - How do you deal with --
  - WHAT?
  - I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
- - Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real
    job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
  - Sounds respectable.
  - Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change
    bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician
    or something.
  - You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
- - He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway,
    Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet.
    Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then
    listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
  - Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
  - We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again
    I was weird.
  - You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
- - No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of
    Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking
    about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because
    I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
  - Glenn talked you out of it.
  - Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't
    remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because
    he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend
    didn't really love me.
- - He was looking out for you.
  - Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled
    hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck
    some sense into me."
- - Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
  - Lily... Jesus Christ...
  - After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The
    next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck
    a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
- - Did, uh... Did you kill him?
  - I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess
    I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
- - No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
  - You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
- - Jesus... Take it easy.
  - No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be
    on this until the end of time.
- - You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
  - Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And
    don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
  - Everyone's working an angle, right?
  - There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know
    who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling
    you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and
    not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
- - What about...
  - What about what?
  - What about the money?
- - So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the
    fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
  - No, I want my cut!
  - I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to
    ten. There is no cut.
- - Sorry. I didn't know...
  - Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
- - You got my cell. Leave a message.
  - It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet
    me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
- - What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
  - You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up.
    You fucked up HUGE.
- - You tell them the "Tale".
  - What do you want? An apology?
  - No, I want my cut!
- - I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
  - Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
  - I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right?
    You heard him!
- - I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
  - Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
- - Oh Jesus!
  - LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have
    to keep your head and trust me!
- - What -- What do we do?
  - Help me.
- - What about... The money?
  - What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
- - Sorry, I --
  - Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once
    or twice.
- - Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
  - Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
  - Great. Thank you.
- - What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
  - My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
- - Attractive girl.
  - Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here
    to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've
    fooled her?
  - Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't
    it?
  - Very much so.
- - Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but
    if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something
    for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the
    chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
  - Sure.
- - What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
  - Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
- - Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business
    in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to
    any of the other criminals.
  - All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got
    sack.
  - Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics,
    then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady
    cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
- - That tip not work-out for you fellas?
  - Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
  - Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
- - Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
  - Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
  - Ring it for him, Sobo.
- - Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
  - Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about
    this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
  - Wouldn't dream of it.
- - I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece,
    understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly
    develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if
    we got a deal, Jake.
  - Something stupid.
  - Good boy.
- - Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under
    control?
  - Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a
    shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
- - Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause
    I would have heard of you, Skippy.
  - Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
  - Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay
    area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that
    little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the
    Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
  - I have a good crew.
  - Minus one.
- - Minus one.
  - You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good
    suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive
    on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days,
    things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take,
    take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
  - I guess it lacks a certain style.
  - Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
  - You can't cheat an honest man.
  - You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
  - I apologize for the inconvenience.
- - Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
  - I can't do that.
  - Why not?
  - Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
  - Let me repeat -- Why not?
  - Because you killed one of my crew.
  - Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
  - I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat,
    I get a cut. And we get square.
  - Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
  - No. Just confidence.
- - I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred
    dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants
    to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or
    is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
  - We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
- - Why?
  - You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
- - How much?
  - I think two million.
  - What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million,
    then do it, Kid.
  - I need you to stake me.
  - Stake you?
  - I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand.
    Taken out of our cut when we're done.
- - That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
  - Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
  - Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
- - Listen, Scooter --
  - No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you,
    I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want
    to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's
    Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could
    be in better shape.
- - Excuse me?
  - I said take off your fucking shirt.
- - Look at you, you skinny prick.
  - You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are
    you?
- - Come here. Feel this.
  - No thanks. I'm good.
  - Come here!
- - Come on. Harder.
  - I think I just broke my hand.
  - Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
- - Shit.
  - I told you, use less powder.
  - But you won't get that splatter effect.
- - What? I can feel you looking at me.
  - That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
  - Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you
    see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
  - I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
- - It can buy you a new and better you.
  - I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
- - Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just
    pulled him out of the East River.
  - Well, this is just fucking great...
  - It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much
    and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant
    for the King Pin.
- - You know what we're doing with the money.
  - And what about Big Al?
  - Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking
    for us, too.
- - When?
  - Tonight. Just me.
- - You gotta be kidding me. Her?
  - Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
- - How much we going after?
  - Two million.
- - We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
  - We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
- - We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start
    up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast.
    Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the
    pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
  - How's that? He works for Gillette.
  - We pay better.
- - Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
  - No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
- - You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York
    city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda.
    You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis,
    influenza, the flesh eating disease --
  - Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank.
    Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
- - She up for this?
  - She's up for it.
- - She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
  - So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The
    code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of
    code on the guy's desk!
- - Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
  - You sure?
- - We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
  - And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and
    push a button tomorrow.
- - You'll be there?
  - Eight A.M. flight.
  - Calls?
  - We'll use the Euc.
- - Jake --
  - What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going
    to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens,
    you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
- - So that's it...
  - That's it.
- - Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
  - I'd like this cashed, please.
- - You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
  - What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
- - Masters of our own destiny.
  - So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
- - Jake...
  - It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
- - I'm going home
  - Let's go, Jake?
- - Moonan. Here. Shit...
  - So what? We just stay clear of him.
- - That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
  - Jake, I mean, come on --
- - Who's that?
  - The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that
    money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept
    this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and
    still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
  - What's a King Pin?
- - Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
  - Mob?
  - Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he
    looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
  - So what? We hide, right?
  - What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls
    this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So
    the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does
    Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he
    tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts
    going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type...
    How HE fleeced.
  - You're pissed we didn't get credit?
  - No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's
    ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating.
    This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's
    way back to someone who works for the King and --
- - Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half
    hours. That's how good he is.
  - We sure Big Al threw him to us?
  - Come on...
- - Whoa. What?
  - We're going to give him the money back?
- - Fuck that. We're going too.
  - Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best
    thing to do?
- - This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever
    heard.
  - People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his
    crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
- - The red hair... It's bad luck.
  - It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
- - Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
  - I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over
    in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
- - Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
  - Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money
    back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like
    that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll
    be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate
    fraud. We double our money.
  - So we go to the bar.
  - I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a
    nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with
    Ashby.
  - We'll take care of it.
  - And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's
    fee?
- - Ten is standard, sir.
  - Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
- - And I think it's because of this redhead...
  - Know who I am, Jake?
  - The Anti-Christ?
  - No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking
    for some answers.
- - Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
  - Gee... What makes you say that?
  - Your life flashing before your eyes?
  - Just the last three weeks.
  - That's not a bad place to start.
- - Grifters...
  - We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
  - It's all about the money, isn't it?
  - Isn't it always?
- - I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got
    me on my knees in a dark alley.
  - And these cops? What do they get?
- - Keeping the Fix happy.
  - You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
  - Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
  - So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
  - In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
- - So how'd you get caught?
  - Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking
    the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
- - I can see why you liked her.
  - That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
- - But there were other factors.
  - Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
- - He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things
    to do with tax payer dollars.
  - Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
- - Nice.
  - We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
- - Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
  - Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes
    with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well...
    It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match
    is bad luck.
  - You're a superstitious fucker.
  - Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
  - Like what?
  - Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck,
    but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
- - She had you tempting fate.
  - My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in
    the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed
    off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for
    one point two million.
- - Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
  - You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in
    the Garden of Eden.
- - So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
  - I was doing it for them.
  - BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence!
    You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit
    it.
  - It's not true.
  - Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there
    for you! Look at her!
- - We were back on.
  - After you cut her loose.
  - She walked.
- - Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
  - Today? Started off great...
- - Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is
    it?
  - Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
- - Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it
    you said about playing the big con?
  - It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
  - Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
  - Guess so.
  - So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
- - Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
  - Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
  - Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
  - What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill
    work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something
    up, do you?
  - I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
- - It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
  - It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd
    get it.
- - Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business.
    No more shithead bosses.
  - I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
- - What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
  - What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
- - Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles
    like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
  - Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
  - Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
  - A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
  - That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
  - They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present
    company excluded of course.
  - Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
  - We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
  - I don't follow.
- - Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have
    you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
  - Big.Com. That Internet thing.
  - Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do.
    They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to
    a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've
    pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already
    set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works.
    So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times
    the initial loan.
  - Sort of like a letter of intent.
  - Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because
    if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of
    etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered
    hot anymore.
  - And you have this letter of intent?
  - Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
- - We had to finalize the deal.
  - Everything looks in order.
  - This has to happen fast.
  - I know. It won't go unnoticed.
  - There'll be red flags.
- - What's this?
  - You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
- - Let's just slow down for a second...
  - You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
  - No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually
    wondering about... Well, my cut.
- - Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
  - The standard ten.
  - Ten percent. Of how much?
  - Two million.
- - Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
  - Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
- - But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
  - I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
- - Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
  - Tough day?
  - Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you
    have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
  - Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
- - My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
  - Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
- - So, what do you do?
  - It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start
    up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in
    the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
  - Silicon Valley?
  - That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate
    east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
- - Can --
  - On me. For the seat. Cheers.
- - So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can
    say "no" without ever using the word.
  - Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need
    to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
- - Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
  - No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
  - Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
- - Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
  - You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
- - That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
  - She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
- - You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
  - The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
  - Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
- - Rose Rose has runned away!
  - She took off in the night!
  - She took off on the bicycle, man.
- - You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
  - He ain't never been outta Maine!
- - Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
  - You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
  - What's lucky about that?
- - That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
  - That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
- - We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
  - Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
  - Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and
    all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
  - You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that
    right, Homer?
- - Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
  - You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
- - Where do you think you're going?
  - You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
- - You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
  - I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
- - You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
  - That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
- - Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
  - What view?
- - '*What* view?'
  - Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
- - Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
  - Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and
    take your time.
- - It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
  - Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
  - I told him that you all is sick.
  - Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
- - She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife
    than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
  - '*You* taught her, I suppose...'
  - That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
- - That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's
    what we say, all right.
  - That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules,
    too. Ain't that right?
- - They told me I was too old to serve.
  - They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
- - Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
  - Mind your own business, Peaches.
  - Sorry, Homer...
- - You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
  - We see you next harvest.
- - Don't this place look like home?
  - It look nicer then home!
  - What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
- - You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
  - They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
  - Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that
    bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got
    no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
- - They're *outrageous*, them rules!
  - Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press
    that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin'
    in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't
    for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every
    day. Ain't that right, Homer?
- - When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together.
    The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was
    still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's
    how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it
    crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
  - Why was he missing for twenty days?
  - Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized
    for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until
    that they sorted through their gear...
- - Then it's malaria?
  - It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh...
    Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
- - No autonomic effects... that's correct.
  - When will he be home, Major?
  - Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
- - Do you know him?
  - '*No*! I don''t want to know him! He''s doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I
    wrote him *weeks* ago, but he''s either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe
    he got killed in the war!'
- - I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign
    mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely
    the kind of dedication that is needed here.
  - Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in
    a *coffin*!
  - You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over
    there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how
    harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
  - Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
- - I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
  - Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I
    didn't think you'd be interested.
- - Who cares?
  - Now, now. He's a good boy.
  - Shit. We don't know what he is.
  - Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
- - I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
  - You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
- - That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons
    of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
  - Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
  - It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You
    just gotta go fishin'.
  - You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
  - What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
- - Rose Rose?
  - Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
- - What's that?
  - It's just my heart.
  - What you got a picture of your heart for?
- - There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle.
    It's slightly enlarged.
  - So what?
  - Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
- - Do you like to read?
  - I can't read. Nobody taught me.
- - You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
  - No trouble.
- - I'm not in trouble.
  - Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
- - Give men that. I know how to do it.
  - Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
  - Almost.
- - You okay, Rose?
  - I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
  - I don't like watching anyone be sick.
- - You're not yet three months, are you?
  - Not yet. What do you know about it?
  - I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
  - Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
  - But you don't look very happy.
  - '*Happy*! What are you thinkin''? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I
    can''t have a baby.'
  - Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
- - What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you
    can go.
  - You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
- - Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
  - Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
- - That's *it*?
  - That's it.
  - It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
- - Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
  - How long's this been going on, Muddy?
  - Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
- - '"One: Please don''t smoke in bed."'
  - We heard that one already, Homer.
  - '"Two: Please don''t go up to the roof to eat your lunch."'
- - Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
  - Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
- - What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy
    here, Homer.
  - Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
  - There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even
    Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
- - I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
  - I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
- - Uh... sure.
  - Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until
    it's over.
- - Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
  - Right.
- - First pregnancy?
  - Yes, for both.
  - I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
  - All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you*
    performing them.
  - You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help
    them when they can't get help anywhere else?
  - 'One: it''s illegal. Two: I didn''t ask how to do it--you just showed me.'
  - What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is
    what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
- - There was no visible wound?
  - No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches
    pulled right through the tissue!
  - It looks like scurvy.
  - Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea
    with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
- - It's obviously an aborticide.
  - Obviously.
- - Christ, it's oil of tansy!
  - I don't know it.
  - If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin
    C.
  - In other words, scurvy.
  - Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's
    in trouble.
- - Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies
    of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
  - I haven't read that.
  - I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a
    little research *here*.
  - But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
  - When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped."
    Would you?
- - Where's the name sheet?
  - Nobody's named this one yet.
  - It's my turn!
- - He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
  - Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
  - I don't think so.
  - You do it then.
- - Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
  - I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
- - Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
  - We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
- - I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your
    splice, isn't it?
  - It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
- - I thought it was my turn.
  - It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
- - How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin
    with?
  - How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
- - It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
  - I'm happy I amuse you.
  - Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options?
    Nobody will ever adopt him.
  - Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you.
    We could have ended up in the incinerator!
  - Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
- - Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing
    it is that you find to do.
  - I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll
    find some ways to be of use.
  - In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
  - Of course.
  - Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying
    life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only
    nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them,
    either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
  - You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
  - I don't need your gratitude.
- - I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
  - It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
- - I am not a doctor.
  - You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better
    doctor then I am and you know it!
- - So. What should I do now?
  - Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized,
    I could put my truck in there.
- - It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
  - Right.
- - Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason
    to read them.
  - Okay...
- - That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you
    got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
  - I guess so...
- - Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
  - Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like
    he's doin' somethin' wrong.
- - Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're
    usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider
    till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins
    and them Russerts...
  - What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right?
    There have to be worms.
  - Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*,
    them worms! They is *good* for you!
- - Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
  - This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
  - You still doin' it too fast!
- - I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up
    a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
  - Is it true?
- - I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
  - You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
  - Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father
    knows.
  - You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
- - Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business
    with me, Homer--ain't that right?
  - Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
- - But she's your *daughter*...
  - And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I
    wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
- - Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
  - You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to
    deal with--ain't that right?
- - What business is you in, Homer?
  - Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't
    have to go anywhere.
- - What's that? What's it called?
  - One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized
    curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
  - There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
- - Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
  - When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
- - I'm stayin', Homer.
  - Okay. Then you can be of use.
- - If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl
    should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
  - Where'd she get you?
  - She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just
    reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all
    my fault, ain't that right?
- - There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
  - That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my
    *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place
    she got me.
- - Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself--
    that what happen here, ain't that right?
  - Right?
- - I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
  - It's okay--I don't mind.
- - So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
  - No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
  - Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
- - What kind of plane are you flying?
  - A B-24 Liberator.
  - Liberator...
  - Have you enlisted?
  - They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
  - Really! Is it serious?
  - No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain,
    no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
- - Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
  - Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
- - I wonder if you might give me a ride.
  - Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
  - Where are you going?
  - We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
- - I think I'd probably like the apple business.
  - You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
  - No, I'm not. I need a job.
  - The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
- - This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's
    the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
  - I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
  - It's all very normal.
- - '"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...'
  - '*And* over the Himalayas. That''s called flying over the hump.'
- - At what altitude?
  - I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first
    mountain pass.
- - What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
  - Actually, I volunteered.
- - Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
  - Oh, I would love that, Wally.
- - They're migrants.
  - Migrants?
  - Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The
    trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
- - It's almost like flying.
  - What about the trees?
  - The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
- - Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were
    settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you
    stick it out for a bit?
  - Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm
    grateful for the job.
  - You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little
    peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
  - Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
  - I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
- - Did you bite it?
  - I don't remember.
  - It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
  - Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
  - No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
  - I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
- - Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
  - Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
  - That's why Kong loves her!
- - '"I was a posthumous child. My father''s eyes had closed upon the light of this
    world six months, when mine opened on it."'
  - His father's dead, right?
- - Uh... it's the end of October.
  - Is that soon?
- - Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
  - Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents
    at Christmas, anyway.
- - Is *your* father dead?
  - Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
  - '*Liver* killed him?'
  - '*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.'
  - But did you know him?
  - Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
  - Did you know your mother better?
  - She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
  - What's a nanny do?
  - She looks after other people's children.
  - Did you grow up around here?
  - No. She was an immigrant.
  - What's an immigrant?
  - Someone not from Maine.
- - Her temperature is a hundred and four.
  - How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
- - That's a heavy sedation.
  - You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured,
    she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet
    hook.
- - I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the
    world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
  - He's leaving...
- - '"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."'
  - Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
  - '"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."'
- - You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
  - Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
- - So here is my candidate. What do you think?
  - But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
- - Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples,
    we don't need!
  - He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to
    send them, too.
  - I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can
    pick his dinner!
- - I just wanted to ask you...
  - Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
  - Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
- - I thought they might take me.
  - They wanted a girl.
  - Nobody ever wants me!
- - You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
  - Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
  - That's true.
  - Nobody's asked for me, have they?
  - Nobody special enough, Curly.
  - You mean somebody asked?
  - Only the right people can have you, Curly.
- - So many children. Are they all orphans?
  - Well, this *is* an orphanage.
- - I'm okay--I can walk.
  - I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might
    get cold.
  - No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
- - Wally thinks apples are boring.
  - I never said they were boring.
  - You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
  - Well, they aren't.
- - There! You said it was boring.
  - Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
- - I love you, Wally.
  - I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
- - I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
  - I know what you've been doing.
- - You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
  - He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
- - He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
  - '*Homer* liked it!  Didn''t you?'
- - How is that Wally doing?
  - Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
- - Hi...
  - Hi...
- - I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with
    me.
  - I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
  - Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year
    ago.  I've been through this.
- - You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
  - Yes, I *have*!
- - I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
  - I can't go nowhere.
  - Why?
- - You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
  - No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
- - So, Mrs...
  - Candy. Candy Kendall.
- - How many months are you?
  - Two.
- - Is your family in the apple business, too?
  - No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
  - I've never seen a lobster.
  - Really?
  - I've never seen the ocean, either.
- - I know.
  - He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
  - Where's Mandalay?
  - Burma!
  - Oh...
  - I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
  - I understand.
- - I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
  - It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll
    ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
- - I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
  - Sure... I'll see you around.
- - So. Not bored yet?
  - I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
- - Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
  - When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness.
    You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
- - You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
  - Okay...
- - I better go.
  - I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
- - A movie *outside*?
  - Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
  - People watched the movies in their cars?
  - When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
  - Yes! I've only seen one, though.
- - You've seen only one movie? Which one?
  - '"King Kong". It''s really good.'
- - But you looked as if you liked it.
  - I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
- - First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
  - She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
- - And what did she die of, exactly?
  - She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
  - Oh, sure!
- - What's the *medical* explanation?
  - Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?!
    Is that medically possible?
- - You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
  - You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
- - The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies
    here?
  - Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
- - What are you so crazy about the movies for?
  - It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining
    hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight
    you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
  - At least you were never lonely.
  - I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just
    never alone.
- - You don't miss it?
  - I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
  - But you had so much *responsibility*.
  - I never *asked* for any responsibility.
  - Just a little privacy.
- - Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
  - Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
- - Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
  - Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
  - The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
- - How could you not *care* about the movie?
  - You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the
    movie.
  - That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
  - Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
- - Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
  - Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the
    glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
- - I *know* this was right.
  - Right.
- - Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
  - It will be okay.
  - '*What* will be okay?'
  - We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait
    and see.
- - Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
  - I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
- - Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you
    think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
  - So we should "wait and see." For how long?
  - I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
  - Fine. That's all there is to it then.
  - No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
  - Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
  - It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
- - We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make
    up her mind when she gets there...
  - I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting
    her go anywhere...
  - Well, we have to help her!
- - She won't go to St. Cloud's!
  - Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
  - You don't understand! It's her father...
  - Mr. Rose *knows*?
  - He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
- - Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
  - We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
- - Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
  - Nothing.
  - Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
  - No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
  - I know.  Is *that* nothing.
  - No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
- - Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
  - '*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn''t it?
    We wouldn''t want to *do* something. Let''s just sit here all night!'
  - If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
  - I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long
    enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions
    can be painful, after all...
- - Stop it! Just cut it out!
  - You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of
    making a *decision*!
  - For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
- - I know, I'm sorry.
  - He's *paralyzed*!
  - He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
  - What do you want me to *do*?
- - Please don't make me say it again.
  - No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
- - I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand
    worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you
    were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how
    I helped you, right?
  - Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
  - '"...did." Well, okay.'
  - Please don't...
  - And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
  - You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
- - Do you think she'll be all right?
  - She knows how to take care of herself.
- - This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything
    happening, I guess she forgot.
  - Sure. Thanks.
- - I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
  - I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
  - No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
  - No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
- - It's time somebody ate *them*.
  - I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him
    a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
  - Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
  - He mentions Homer, too, you know.
  - Wally said to say, "Hello."
- - It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
  - Good night, Daddy.
- - How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
  - Daddy, *please*...
- - Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
  - Good night, Daddy.
- - What'd she die of?
  - She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
- - What are you going to tell the little ones?
  - I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
  - Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
  - They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
  - Shouldn't we tell Homer?
  - If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone
    and call us.
- - He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
  - It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
  - He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
  - He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
  - '*You''re* a doctor, Homer--you don''t smell like ether.'
  - I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high
    school!
  - But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
  - I'm *not* a doctor!
  - I'm sorry, Homer.
- - I mean your parents.
  - I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
  - Why not?
  - Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to
    do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
  - Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
  - What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
  - Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
  - You cook very well!
  - And that I can drive a truck!
  - Better than I can!
  - Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
- - Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
  - I know.
- - I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
  - I doubt it. She's just an...
- - What's she so emotional about?
  - I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
- - Only if you can afford it.
  - Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
- - It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
  - It claims to restore monthly regularity.
- - Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
  - Life is waiting.
- - I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
  - You weren't dreaming about me.
  - I was!
- - Then I wasn't beautiful.
  - You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
  - It was just the ether, Wilbur...
- - They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
  - They just want you to hire some new help.
  - Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
- - He'll need clothes... some money...
  - Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
  - Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
  - He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
  - Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
- - He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if
    he could help *commit* me!
  - It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
  - One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian
    zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
- - This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
  - '"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch.
    For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon;
    he is also experienced in pediatric care..."'
  - You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
  - Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new
    blood" is *for*!
- - These *credentials* are against the law!
  - We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't
    you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
- - Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many
    apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't
    meant for pies!
  - Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
  - You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
- - I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
  - Dr. Homer Wells.
  - I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
- - Permission to come aboard, sir.
  - Permission granted.
  - May I ask, where are you bound?
  - San Francisco.  And you?
  - As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
  - Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork
    chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked
    bread, apple pie...
  - No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to
    munch on.
- - What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke
    down?
  - Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
- - How'd it go?
  - Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
- - You what?
  - It was fifteen minutes late.
- - I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
  - But I might not have.
  - Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally
    a team...
  - I'm touched.
  - You fucked us over.
  - The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
  - I was making a point.
  - What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down
    the line clean up your mess?
  - Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
  - You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You
    don't see the big picture.
  - Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
- - I didn't know we had sailboats.
  - It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
  - For all those vacation days you got coming.
- - And never take.
  - Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
  - Forget it.
  - You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally
    Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army,
    could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's
    go.
  - I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay
    attention.
  - We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all
    your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49.
    Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
  - That's why you're a gambling man.
  - That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married
    and I am.
  - For the third time.
  - Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's
    women, that's life.
- - You are one sick fucker.
  - I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
  - This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big
    a deal.
- - A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
  - Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
  - Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
  - We're on.
- - Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
  - Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
- - Hello?
  - Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
- - God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
  - It's me.
  - You're fucking dead!
  - I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
- - I beat the odds!
  - You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
- - Hello.
  - This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
- - How about we go somewhere else?
  - Want to see my raft?
- - This stinks really bad.
  - You should have smelled me.
- - Cool ropes.
  - I braided them.
  - Must have taken a hell of a long time.
  - Time I had lots of.
- - You were how long on this?
  - Forty-three days.
- - When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
  - I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't
    stop laughing.
- - To Wilson.
  - To Wilson.
- - You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
  - Hallelujah.
- - I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
  - What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone
    to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
- - To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
  - To life.
  - That's all there is.
  - Believe me I know.
- - Digital laser readers.
  - Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
- - Take your time.
  - What?
  - That's what it's about.
  - Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
- - Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
  - Deep, real deep.
- - What, then?
  - Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
  - You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
  - I need to do it.
  - Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
- - Thanks.  For everything.
  - No sweat.
- - Kamal is not here.
  - Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
  - It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
  - What's going on down there?
  - Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
  - Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
- - Trying.
  - Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
- - Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because
    we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku.
    Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala
    Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses
    after K.L.
  - What about the sender?
  - Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
- - Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
  - Can you find her?
  - You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I
    don't have it.
- - What happened to your pants?
  - Mom, meet Jango.
- - It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
  - It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
- - Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
  - That new roof, that's your doing.
- - Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real
    cream.
  - Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
- - Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help
    around here...
  - Don't you even think about it.
  - The place is falling apart.
  - I'm doing fine.
- - Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
  - There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You
    never belonged here.
- - When'd you start working here?
  - Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really
    back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
  - I wanted to come here.
- - I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
  - This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
- - What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
  - The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take
    me next.
- - Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou
    bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
  - Let's eat.
- - Thought you were going to bring her.
  - So did I.
- - But chickens?
  - Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to
    pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus
    and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
  - True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
- - Really?
  - Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what
    FedEx did for the delivery business.
  - Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
- - Need some help?
  - You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
- - You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
  - No.
- - I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
  - Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more
    pickup.
  - Sure.
- - You're Chuck Noland.
  - Yeah.
- - My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
  - Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you
    picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
- - Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
  - Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
  - All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
  - Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
  - Which I didn't have.
  - And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to
    burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and
    pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
- - I am one lucky guy.
  - Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability,
    depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different
    sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
  - But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
- - If you say you are.
  - I most definitely say I am.
  - Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
- - Yes, yes he did.
  - You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return
    to your old life?
  - Not to mention on me.
- - Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to
    be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
  - Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
- - I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
  - And how was your Christmas?
  - Terrific.  Yours?
- - When's the next Jumbo?
  - The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
  - Anything else?
  - There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
- - Sonofabitch!
  - Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
- - Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
  - You smell like formaldehyde.
- - My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
  - Let's take a look.
- - How was Russia?
  - Cold.
  - Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
  - I thought I did.
- - Got to follow the paper path here.
  - Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
- - Chuck.
  - What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned
    to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
  - Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
- - Merry Christmas eve.
  - Not if you work for FedEx.
- - Four four.  A record.
  - You don't seem too happy about it.
  - Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
  - Let me guess, Russia came up?
- - Hey, look at you.
  - I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
- - He is a cute thing.
  - He's your cute thing.
  - I can't even keep fish alive.
  - A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
  - And for you --
- - You know, for when you travel.
  - For when I travel?
- - I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
  - A ring.  I wanted a ring.
  - You did?
- - Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
  - You can't go now.
  - I have to.
  - You want to.
- - This isn't working out.
  - We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
  - '"We''re" not over-reacting.'
  - Could you watch Jango?
  - No.
  - I can't take him to work.
- - That's your dog.
  - It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
  - There isn't any us.
  - Yes there is.
- - I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
  - No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
  - I burned the Christmas tree.
- - Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
  - I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
  - What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really
    made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
  - Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
  - Don't even start.
- - Get back?  From where?
  - Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
- - Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
  - A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
  - Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
- - I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
  - Hey...hey...it's okay!
- - Right back, you said you'd be right back.
  - A few things came up.  Or went down.
- - I got married.
  - I thought you might have.
  - I would never --
  - I know.
  - If I'd known you were alive --
  - I would have done the same thing.
- - I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of
    everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
  - You have any children?
- - Her name's Hannah.
  - Is that Jango?
  - No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
- - What's that?
  - That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps
    you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water.
    About half a cup a day.
- - All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
  - Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
- - What's that, written on the sail?
  - My epitaph.
- - There was a coffin?
  - Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
  - What was inside?
  - Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that
    ketch you wanted.
  - That about sums it up.
  - Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
  - The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found
    these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
  - Yeah?
  - The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
  - Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
- - Come on.  Try.
  - Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff.
    Live each day like it's your last.
  - So simple to say, so hard to do.
  - Not when you have no choice.
- - You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged
    into something.
  - I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
- - This is so unfair.
  - That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
- - You okay?
  - Great.  Really.
- - What will you do?
  - I don't know.  I really don't know.
- - I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
  - It means a lot...that you came.
  - I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
- - I love you, Chuck.
  - You too.
  - I'm so glad you're alive.
- - Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that
    just some bullshit story?
  - I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
- - What brings you out to the sticks?
  - Had a package to deliver.
  - You?  Personally?
  - I had it on the island with me.
  - Must be a story there.
- - Yeah, a long one.
  - I've got lots of time.
  - So do I.
- - You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
  - There was an unavoidable delay.
- - Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
  - No.
- - You know what happened to this?
  - As much as anybody.
  - Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
  - Okay.  Sure.
- - Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
  - Possible.  So you did those wings?
  - Yeah.  A long time ago.
  - They're harder to do than they look.
  - Oh?  You've tried?
  - Well, I do a little drawing --
- - Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
  - He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
- - I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into
    something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
  - Well, not really, I --
  - You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
- - To tell you the truth -- you did.
  - Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
  - No.  that was the last one.
  - Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
- - Keep painting.  Promise me.
  - Sure.
- - Save some for tomorrow.
  - Catch another fish tomorrow.
- - Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
  - Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
  - With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going
    to drown.
- - Get up.
  - Feels so good to lie here.
  - Get up, damn you.
- - Can't.  Need water.
  - You've had today's water.
  - Thirsty.
  - Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
  - No water, no work.
- - Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot,
    you've just got to do a little more.
  - Do too much, I'll die.
  - Do too little you'll die.
  - Going to die anyway.
- - No more water, you said.
  - Take it.
  - No.
  - Take it, damn it.
  - No.
  - Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
- - If they can't see you, what's the point?
  - Survive today, that's the point.
- - Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
  - You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
  - Moon's too bright.
- - You're putting off the inevitable.
  - I'm putting it off.
- - Get water!
  - Fix raft first.
  - Water water water --
- - You're beautiful.  Marry me.
  - You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
- - What are you doing?
  - Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
  - You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
  - Why do they have to die for me?
  - They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
- - I'm lost.  Goodbye.
  - No!
- - Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft
    and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
  - You quitter you quitter you quitter.
  - The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
  - But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go
    before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
  - Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
  - If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
  - Die tomorrow or die today.
- - That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking,
    knocking at my front door...
  - Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
  - Yeah, sure, what?
- - You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
  - Thank you for fucking up my life.
- - What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
  - I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
- - They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
  - They're on autopilot.
  - They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're
    in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
  - Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
- - I float.  You sink.  End of story.
  - I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
  - It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
  - Shut up.
- - What's so damn funny?
  - You are.
- - Jesus.
  - Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
- - It's real.
  - Nothing out there but ocean.
  - Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
- - What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just
    start over again.
  - It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
  - Then we've just got shit.
- - You can't make it.
  - Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
- - It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg,
    a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from
    our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
  - Six kilometers.  Four miles.
  - So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
- - It's bad.
  - Worse than Warsaw.
  - Nobody remembers that.
  - The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
- - Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
  - I like it fine here.
  - He'll double what I pay you.
  - Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
  - Sorry.
- - Boss!
  - Yeah?
  - Boss, ain't you going to bed?
  - Not right now.
- - Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
  - No.
  - You ever going to bed?
  - No.
  - Well, I ain't sleepy either.
  - Good. Then have a drink.
  - No. Not me, boss.
  - Then don't have a drink.
  - Boss, let's get out of here.
  - No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
  - Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
  - She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
  - We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and
    stay away until she's gone.
  - Shut up and go home, will you?
  - No, sir. I'm staying right here.
- - They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out.
    Sam?
  - Yeah, boss?
  - Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
  - Uh, my watch stopped.
  - I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
- - What's that you're playing?
  - Just a little something of my own.
  - Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
  - No, I don't.
  - You played it for her and you can play it for me.
  - Well, I don't think I can remember it.
  - If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
  - Yes, boss.
- - This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
  - You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
- - And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other
    three.
  - The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And
    don't forget there's a price on your head.
- - Where is she? Have you seen her?
  - No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
- - Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
  - Hello Ugarte.
- - Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would
    think you'd been doing this all your life.
  - Well, what makes you think I haven't?
  - Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
  - -- You thought what?
- - May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
  - They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're
    the 'Honored Dead'.
  - You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
- - Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
  - No.
  - I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me,
    don't you?
  - If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
  - But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those
    poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so
    bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
  - For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
  - But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for
    them for half. Is that so parasitic?
  - I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
  - Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving
    finally this Casablanca.
  - Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
  - Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
- - One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever
    dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in
    Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust.
    Will you keep these for me? Please.
  - For how long?
  - Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
  - I don't want them here overnight.
  - Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust
    you.
- - Rick! Rick, help me!
  - Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
  - Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
- - Make it official, if you like.
  - What is your nationality?
  - I'm a drunkard.
- - I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
  - There seems to be no secret about that.
  - Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
  - It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
- - Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you
    to try to invade.
  - Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
  - I haven't the slightest idea.
- - Are my eyes really brown?
  - You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich
    has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help
    to us.
  - My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
  - In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
  - Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
  - Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very
    day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in
    a cellar.
- - You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
  - Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
- - I would advise you not to interfere.
  - I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
- - Hello?
  - Put that phone down!
  - Get me the Radio Tower!
  - Put it down!
- - Where were you last night?
  - That's so long ago, I don't remember.
  - Will I see you tonight?
  - I never make plans that far ahead.
- - Give me another.
  - Sacha, she's had enough.
  - Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
- - Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
  - -- Sacha, call a cab.
- - Come on, we're going to get your coat.
  - Take your hands off me!
- - Hello, Louis.
  - How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
- - You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound,
    eh?
  - When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
- - The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
  - Why? What's in Lisbon?
  - The clipper to America.
- - It was a combination of all three.
  - And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
  - My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
  - Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
  - I was misinformed.
  - Huh!
- - Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an
    arrest in your cafe.
  - What, again?
  - This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
- - If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly
    escape.
  - I stick my neck out for nobody.
  - A wise foreign policy.
- - You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue
    Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse
    your customers.
  - Our entertainment is enough.
- - I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to
    Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
  - Perhaps not.
- - How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
  - Yeah? Have a brandy?
  - Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that
    you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
  - I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
  - That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way
    to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit
    visa.
  - Yeah? What's his name?
  - Victor Laszlo.
  - Victor Laszlo?
- - Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
  - Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
  - It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must
    never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
  - It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
  - Manages what?
  - His escape.
  - Oh, but I just told you. --
  - -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing
    him all over Europe.
  - This is the end of the chase.
  - Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
- - Is that a serious offer?
  - I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
  - Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
  - Okay.
  - Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say,
    two.
  - Why two?
  - He is traveling with a lady.
  - He'll take one.
  - I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles,
    or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
  - Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
  - It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
  - Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping
    Laszlo escape?
  - Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart
    a sentimentalist.
- - Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point
    out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain
    on the Loyalist side.
  - And got well paid for it on both occasions.
  - The winning side would have paid you much better.
  - Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
  - I have my orders.
  - Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
- - Yeah, you were saying?
  - Excuse me.
- - Oh, how do you do?
  - And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
- - That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
  - I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
- - Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
  - -- Hello, Ilsa.
- - Oh, no, Rick never --
  - -- Thanks. I will.
- - Oh, it's my party.
  - Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you
    a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
- - Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
  - That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely
    got cleaned up in time to open.
- - Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to
    be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you
    got these letters of transit?
  - Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
  - Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
  - Well, it looks like you're a little late.
  - Huh?
- - So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
  - Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's
    time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
- - As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
  - Yeah? Why?
  - Why do you interfere with my little romances?
  - Put it down as a gesture to love.
  - Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking
    blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
- - How can you close me up? On what grounds?
  - I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
- - But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied
    France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days.
    You might as well let him go now.
  - Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by
    any chance you were to help him escape --
  - -- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
  - Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters
    of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because
    you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
  - Well, they're all excellent reasons.
  - Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides,
    I might lose ten thousand francs.
  - You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have
    the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's
    plane, the last plane.
  - Huh?
  - And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
  - What friend?
  - Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape.
    The last man I want to see in America.
  - You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can
    fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested
    in what happens to Laszlo?
- - Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know.
    Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against
    him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration
    camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
  - It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
  - Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
- - I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and
    that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him,
    and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
  - There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund,
    she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
  - Well, she isn't just any woman.
- - I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
  - I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
  - Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who
    has even less scruples than I.
  - Oh, thanks.
  - Go ahead, Ricky.
- - You're late.
  - I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on
    time.
  - I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
  - Oh, he won't be followed here.
- - You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
  - Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win
    at roulette.
  - Is everything ready?
- - I have the letters right here.
  - Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
  - Sam's piano.
  - Serves me right for not being musical.
- - -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
  - Have you taken leave of your senses?
  - I have. Sit down over there.
  - Put that gun down.
- - I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
  - I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
  - Call off your watch-dogs you said.
  - Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember,
    this gun's pointed right at your heart.
  - That is my least vulnerable spot.
- - If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
  - You think of everything, don't you?
  - And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
- - Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
  - Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
- - What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa
    away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew
    you were lying.
  - Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
  - I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially
    for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
  - As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
- - Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
  - Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
  - I think perhaps you're right.
- - It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's
    a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
  - My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about
    our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
  - And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
  - Our expenses?
  - Uh huh.
  - Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
- - Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
  - Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
  - Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
- - You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
  - Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps
    you were not referring to the weather.
  - What else, my dear Major?
  - By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
  - Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number
    of suspects.
- - Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
  - I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
- - Good evening, gentlemen.
  - Good evening, Captain.
- - Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
  - Champagne and a tin of caviar.
  - May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
  - Thank you.
- - Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the
    man who murdered your couriers.
  - I expected no less, Captain.
- - Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
  - How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- - You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
  - Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
  - Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
- - Ho, diplomatist!
  - How about New York?
- - Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women,
    too.
  - You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
- - Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
  - I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris
    he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
- - You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
  - Perhaps.
- - Mademoiselle.
  - Mademoiselle.
- - I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I
    would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
  - If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
  - You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just
    another blundering American.
  - But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered"
    into Berlin in 1918.
- - As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
  - It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
- - You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
  - My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot
    regulate the feelings of our people.
- - Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
  - I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing
    wind happens to be from Vichy.
  - And if it should change?
- - We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province
    in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps,
    for a leader.
  - A leader, like Laszlo?
  - Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be
    too dangerous if we let him stay.
  - I see what you mean.
- - You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate
    demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that
    this place be shut up at once.
  - But everybody's having such a good time.
  - Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
  - But I have no excuse to close it.
  - Find one.
- - What is the meaning of that phone call?
  - Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
- - Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
  - Ask Monsieur Rick.
- - I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm
    a Czechoslovakian.
  - You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
- - I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
  - I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
  - This is hardly the time or the place.
  - Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's
    office, with Mademoiselle.
  - Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your
    office?
- - Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of
    the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached
    Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
  - Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
  - Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain,
    would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
- - Is that all you wish to tell us?
  - Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca
    indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
  - And that is?
  - You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels,
    in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
  - Even in Berlin.
  - Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts,
    you will have your visa in the morning.
- - You will give us the names?
  - If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive
    methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
- - And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of
    us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places.
    Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
  - Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But
    in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be
    replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event
    anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
  - You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any
    violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
- - For the time being.
  - Good day.
- - Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
  - Yes.
  - I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
  - Yes. What is it you want?
  - Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often
    we have so distinguished a visitor.
  - Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration
    has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
  - I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That
    was a gross understatement.
- - No, Captain, please.
  - No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I
    tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
- - Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
  - Very well.
- - My bill.
  - No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
- - Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
  - This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
- - Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
  - Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
  - So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief
    of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
- - Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
  - We'll be there.
  - Goodnight.
- - I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
  - I slept very well.
  - That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
  - May we proceed with the business?
  - With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
  - Thank you.
- - I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
  - Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
- - And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
  - I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- - Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
  - -- Thank you.
  - By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
  - Yes.
  - I believe you have a message for him?
  - Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
- - I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed
    suicide or died trying to escape.
  - Are you quite finished with us?
- - How do you do?
  - How do you do?
  - One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
  - And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
  - Won't you join us for a drink?
- - And I congratulate you.
  - What for?
  - Your work.
  - Thank you. I try.
  - We all try. You succeed.
- - I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
  - Not at all.
- - We'll come again.
  - Any time.
- - Good morning.
  - Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
- - Good evening.
  - Good evening. You see, here we are again.
  - I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of,
    well, happier days.
- - Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
  - Go ahead.
  - Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
  - My office.
  - Right.
- - You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to
    be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You
    know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people
    that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
  - I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department.
    I'm a saloon keeper.
  - My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns
    to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
  - What of it?
  - Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
  - Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a
    businessman.
- - Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
  - I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
  - I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
  - My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still
    be the same.
  - There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
  - There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
  - I beg your pardon?
  - I said, ask your wife.
  - My wife?
- - Well, this might come in handy.
  - Thank you.
  - Had a close one, eh?
  - Yes, rather.
- - Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting
    for?
  - We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If
    we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
  - What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
- - You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself
    of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good
    or for evil.
  - Yes, I get the point.
- - I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself
    and that you'll never succeed.
  - You seem to know all about my destiny.
  - I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that
    you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in
    love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there
    was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation.
    I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But
    I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her
    away from Casablanca.
  - You love her that much?
  - Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human
    being.
- - Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
  - Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
- - I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
  - Keep it. You'll need it in America.
  - But we made a deal.
  - Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
  - No. It's all arranged.
  - Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
- - Everything in order?
  - All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
  - Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
  - I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said
    you knew about Ilsa and me.
  - Yes.
  - But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there
    for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
- - I understand.
  - Here it is.
- - Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
  - Sam?
  - Yes.
  - He came from Paris with Rick.
  - Rick? Who's he?
  - Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
  - -- Is what?
  - Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were
    not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful
    woman about another man.
- - Hello, Rick.
  - Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
- - Well then, perhaps you also ---
  - -- This is Mr. Laszlo.
- - I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that
    made me extremely jealous.
  - I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
- - I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
  - You're saying this only to make me go.
- - Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
  - If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's
    in some other part of the cafe.
- - You are very kind.
  - Won't you join us?
- - This time they really mean to stop me.
  - Victor, I'm afraid for you.
  - We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
- - I must find out what Berger knows.
  - Be careful.
  - I will, don't worry.
- - Goodnight.
  - Goodnight.
- - Goodnight.
  - Goodnight.
- - We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
  - Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
  - No, Victor, no.
- - No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me,
    somehow I will get out and join you.
  - But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were
    only a visa for one, would you take it?
  - Yes, I would.
- - Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there?
    And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in
    danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
  - I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
- - He does. Could we have a table close to him?
  - And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
- - What happened with Rick?
  - We'll discuss it later.
- - Our faithful friend is still there.
  - Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
  - I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before
    his wife.
- - Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
  - To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room
    hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
- - Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What
    did you find out?
  - Apparently he has the letters.
  - Yes?
  - But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade
    him, money would.
- - Did he give any reason?
  - He suggested I ask you.
  - Ask me?
  - Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
- - Ilsa, I --
  - -- Yes?
  - When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
- - Yes, Victor, I was.
  - I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
  - No, Victor, there isn't.
  - I love you very much, my dear.
- - Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
  - -- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
- - Be careful.
  - Of course, I'll be careful.
- - Are you ready Ilsa?
  - Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
- - Hello, Sam.
  - Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
- - It's been a long time.
  - Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
  - Some of the old songs, Sam.
  - Yes, ma'am.
- - Where is Rick?
  - I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
- - When will he be back?
  - Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
  - Does he always leave so early?
  - Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there
    all the time.
  - You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
  - Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
  - Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
  - I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
  - Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
  - Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
- - -- It was "La Belle Aurore."
  - How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched
    into Paris.
  - Not an easy day to forget.
  - No.
  - I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
  - Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
- - Say goodnight to Sam for me.
  - I will.
  - There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
  - He hasn't played it in a long time.
- - Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you
    think? Huh?
  - We said "no questions."
  - Here's looking at you, kid.
- - A franc for your thoughts.
  - In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
  - I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
  - And I was wondering.
  - Yes?
  - Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
  - Why there is no other man in my life?
  - Uh huh.
  - That's easy. There was. He's dead.
  - I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
  - Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
- - Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
  - I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
- - My German's a little rusty.
  - It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
- - With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
  - Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
  - Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where
    were you?
  - Looking for a job.
- - Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
  - Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five
    miles away.
- - Strange. I know so very little about you.
  - I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
- - But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
  - No, no, no, no. We must leave.
  - Yes, of course, we --
  - -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel
    at four-thirty.
  - No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave.
    I'll meet you at the station, huh?
  - All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
- - That's too far ahead to plan.
  - Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer?
    Why can't he marry us on the train?
  - Oh, darling!
- - Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey,
    what's wrong, kid?
  - I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything
    can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us
    apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
- - Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
  - No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
  - Especially tonight.
- - Please.
  - Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
  - I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's
    true. I didn't know.
  - It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard
    dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
  - Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
  - Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
  - I didn't count the days.
  - Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish.
    A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face,
    because his insides had been kicked out.
- - Can I tell you a story, Rick?
  - Has it got a wow finish?
  - I don't know the finish yet.
  - Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
  - It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house
    of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great
    and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge
    and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.
    And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
  - Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard
    a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing
    in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always
    begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was
    it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't
    you the kind that tells?
- - I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
  - It doesn't matter.
- - Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
  - Yes.
  - Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
  - I don't think I will, Rick.
  - Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to
    know.
  - Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell
    him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll
    be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very
    little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way,
    maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
  - Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would
    be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
  - You can believe that if you want to.
  - Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true,
    but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
- - All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
  - No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew
    you in Paris.
- - How did you get in?
  - The stairs from the street.
- - I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule.
    Well, won't you sit down?
  - Richard, I had to see you.
  - You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
  - Please.
  - Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?
    It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
  - You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
  - I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
  - I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for
    something more important.
  - Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause
    he's fighting for?
  - It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
  - I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested
    in.
- - Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all
    to you --
  - -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
  - Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew
    the truth --
  - -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now
    to get what you want.
- - No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If
    you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
  - What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
- - -- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those
    letters. Get them for me.
  - I don't have to. I've got them right here.
  - Put them on the table.
  - No.
  - For the last time, put them on the table.
  - If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right,
    I'll make it easier for you.
- - And then?
  - 'It wasn''t long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
    They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a
    two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration
    camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead,
    shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met
    you.'
  - Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
- - Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest
    friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so
    much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous
    for me and for those working with me.
  - When did you first find out he was alive?
  - Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me
    that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts
    of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care.
    I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught
    you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
  - Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
  - Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
  - And Laszlo?
  - Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then
    he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
  - All except one. He won't have you.
- - I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I
    don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all
    of us.
  - All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
  - I wish I didn't love you so much.
- - Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
  - No, not yet.
  - But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
  - Everything is quite all right.
  - Oh, Rick!
- - But why my name, Richard?
  - Because you're getting on that plane.
  - I don't understand. What about you?
  - I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
- - No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
  - -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for
    both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing.
    You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
  - But Richard, no, I, I --
  - -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward
    to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration
    camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
- - I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.
    You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves
    the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
  - No.
  - Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
  - But what about us?
  - We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca.
    We got it back last night.
  - And I said I would never leave you.
  - And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow.
    What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble,
    but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't
    amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that.
    Now, now...
- - Yes.
  - She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince
    me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your
    sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
- - And Mademoiselle?
  - You needn't be concerned about me.
- - Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
  - This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
  - That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
  - Occupied France?
  - Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
  - What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the
    past.
  - There are only two other alternatives for him.
  - What are they?
  - It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration
    camp here.
  - And the other alternative?
  - My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human
    life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
- - You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
  - As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected
    man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however,
    are a different matter.
  - Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
- - I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
  - -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out
    of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
- - We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit
    visas. Thank you very much.
  - Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
- - I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved
    to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit
    me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
  - Yes, something.
  - Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
- - Do you know where they are?
  - Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters
    with Monsieur Rick.
- - Rick?
  - He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But
    it is worth a chance.
  - Thank you very much. Good day.
- - It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
  - Good day.
- - Hello, Rick.
  - Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
  - Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
  - It's not for sale.
  - You haven't heard my offer.
  - It's not for sale at any price.
  - What do you want for Sam?
  - I don't buy or sell human beings.
  - That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could
    make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
  - Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
  - Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
  - Suppose we do.
  - My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no
    longer a practical policy?
- - I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
  - No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
  - I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always
    just a little bit short.
  - Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something
    I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
- - The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
  - You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
- - Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows
    where those letters of transit are.
  - Practically no one.
  - If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
  - So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
  - I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction,
    get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
  - And the carrying charges?
  - Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have
    for whoever has those letters.
  - I'll tell him when he comes in.
  - Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
  - Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
- - That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
  - Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
- - Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
  - It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
- - Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
  - Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five
    percent of the profits. That still goes.
  - Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
  - And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
  - Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
  - Well, so long.
- - Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
  - I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
- - Here's to you, sir.
  - Er, good luck, yes.
  - I'd better be going.
  - Er, my check, please.
  - I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
- - Er, goodbye, sir.
  - It has been a pleasure to meet you.
- - Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs.
    The cashier would like some money.
  - Well, I'll get it from the safe.
  - I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
  - -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
  - I'm awfully sorry.
- - Here you are.
  - It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
  - That's all right.
- - Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
  - No thanks, Carl.
  - Monsieur Rick!
- - Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
  - How long can I afford to stay closed?
  - Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
  - Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays
    on salary.
  - Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
- - Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
  - I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
  - -- Don't tell me where you're going.
  - I won't.
  - Goodnight.
  - Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
- - The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
  - Come up here a minute.
- - Yes, I come.
  - I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
  - But Sacha always puts out that light --
  - -- Tonight he forgot.
  - Yes, I come, I will do it.
- - I want you to take Miss Lund home.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
  - Well?
- - You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great
    sacrifice.
  - Thank you, but I hardly think --
  - -- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
- - Good.
  - What is your name?
  - Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
- - Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
  - I'm sorry. It is.
- - Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
  - Yes, Monsieur.
  - A champagne cocktail, please.
- - I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
  - In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
  - We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
  - As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I
    am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
- - I see.
  - But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground
    like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois.
    If you would come...
- - Monsieur Rick?
  - Yes?
  - Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
- - How did you get in here? You're under age.
  - I came with Captain Renault.
  - I should have known.
  - My husband is with me, too.
  - He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a
    drink?
- - No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
  - No.
- - Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
  - Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
  - No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
  - -- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
  - He did. Captain Renault did.
  - I thought so. Where's your husband?
  - At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course,
    he's losing.
- - How long have you been married?
  - Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A
    devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children
    to grow up in such a country.
  - So you decided to go to America.
  - Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult.
    It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us
    and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
  - Yes, I'll bet.
  - He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
  - Does he know that?
  - Oh, yes.
  - And he is still willing to give you a visa?
  - Yes, Monsieur.
  - And you want to know --
  - -- Will he keep his word?
  - He always has.
- - Nobody ever loved me that much.
  - And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That
    would be all right, wouldn't it?
  - You want my advice?
  - Oh, yes, please.
  - Go back to Bulgaria.
  - Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh,
    but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older
    than he is.
  - Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse
    me.
- - Monsieur Rick, I --
  - -- He's just a lucky guy.
- - You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna
    fix it.
  - You're such a retard!
- - Here you go, buddy.
  - What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
  - The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
  - Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
- - Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
  - Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
- - Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
  - I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
  - Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're
    the Sheriff of Nottingham!
  - I thought I was the bad guy!
  - You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
- - What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
  - Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
  - Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would
    you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
- - Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the
    way Evan's mom was looking at you?
  - I'm sorry.
- - Lenny? Come on!
  - Oh my God oh my God...
- - Shut up, Tommy!
  - Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
- - Just get out, didja?
  - Huh?
  - Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
  - I come from a big family.
  - Meant no offense.
  - None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
  - Sorry. Never heard of her.
- - Hey, what'd you do that for?
  - Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
- - Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
  - Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
- - Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
  - What happened?? Where are we?!
- - Look what you made me do!
  - What's wrong with you?!
- - Leave us alone you sick fuck!
  - Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done
    nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking
    my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
- - What the hell are you doing?
  - It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the
    last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
  - No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
  - Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
- - Listen to me good, Evan...
  - I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine.
    Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy
    for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
- - I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and
    we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
  - Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila
    til I puke.
- - Lung cancer?
  - Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
- - Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
  - I think I'll go check out the chapel.
- - Can... can... Can I have this?
  - Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
- - That should buy you ten minutes at least.
  - Gee, thanks friend.
- - I couldn't cut the rope.
  - Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
  - Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
- - You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew
    something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
  - Y... yes. I guess I did.
- - Uh, we should be getting to class now.
  - Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt
    farmer in Bangladesh.
- - Are you sure you even packed it?
  - My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
- - What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
  - Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
  - What?
  - Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
  - Destroy it?
  - If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place.
    Now shhhh.
- - So what's the point?
  - Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help
    me understand the complexities of the human brain.
- - Smells like sex in here.
  - Thumper had a busy afternoon.
  - You're kidding. He's so... big.
- - Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
  - Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
  - Wow... read something.
- - Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get
    a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've
    got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
  - Deal. Now read me something.
- - Come on, go on...
  - It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that
    I couldn't really call human.
- - It didn't feel like a dream.
  - Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
- - I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition
    his dogs to lick his nuts?
  - Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still
    planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
  - Hey, I got no choice.
- - Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project
    was coming.
  - Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
  - I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
- - Just don't drop the ball, okay?
  - I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
- - Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
  - I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
  - And you are...?
  - Evan Treborn.
  - The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
- - Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
  - We'll find out soon enough.
  - Me neither.
- - You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
  - Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
  - Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow.
    If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
  - I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
- - It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
  - Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
- - Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
  - Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
- - I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
  - But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only
    one who can give it to me.
  - There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
  - Who's to say you can't make things better?
- - You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing
    your mother.
  - Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
- - We're really gonna be in a movie!?
  - That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
- - Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
  - Calm down, kid. Stand still.
- - I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
  - Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty
    little shit you've been.
  - Kayleigh? What happened?
- - What time is it?
  - It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
  - Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next
    thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever
    traumatize your own flesh and blood.
- - What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
  - It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only
    concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll
    lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
  - Who -- who are you?
- - Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get
    your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving
    father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
  - '...yes.'
  - Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate
    you.
- - Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
  - And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors.
    One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
- - That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
  - Been there, done that.
- - We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
  - So let's go. This place creeps me out.
- - Oh God... what did we do?
  - Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
- - I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
  - You really don't remember anything that happened?
- - Ouch.
  - I'm sorry.
- - It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to
    Lenny.
  - Damn. Your dad did this?
- - I deserve a lot worse.
  - What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All
    they do is make you feel like shit.
- - I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
  - He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
  - Duck, here they come.
- - Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
  - He must be. They're letting him go, right?
- - Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
  - Hi, Lenny.
- - God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
  - Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
  - No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
  - I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
- - Not since we were kids.
  - I've stopped a hundred times.
  - So how's Tommy?
  - They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
- - No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
  - Wow. That must've taken some courage.
  - Not if you remember my dad.
  - Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
  - She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with
    her when we were kids. But... whatever.
- - Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
  - Me? Are you kidding? Why?
  - Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
  - Of course.
  - Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to
    talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
  - Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
  - When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
  - What do you want to know, Evan?
  - It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
  - It was a long time ago.
  - I know, but...
  - Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about
    Robin Hood?
  - No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
- - Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
  - You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
  - Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up
    my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder
    and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's
    gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
- - Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
  - Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
- - Where... where are my clothes?
  - Those are your clothes, silly.
- - Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your
    dad first got his video camera?
  - Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why
    would that freak me out?
  - I dunno.  Just being weird.
- - Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
  - So it didn't feel... weird?
  - Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
- - What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back,
    whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
  - As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
- - I don't understand, where are you taking me?
  - You'll see.
- - I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
  - Go on. Sit down.
- - Why are you doing all this for me?
  - Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted
    to spend the rest of my life with you.
- - It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
  - Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys
    has a gun.
  - Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare
    you away from me.
  - Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
  - It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
  - Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out
    fine.
  - My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
- - Are you okay?
  - What do you mean?
  - It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
  - Like how?
  - I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed.
    You don't even walk the same.
  - I walk differently?
  - I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight.
    It was beautiful, but...
  - I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything
    to happen to us.
- - Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
  - What?
- - Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
  - He's a fucking maniac!
- - I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty
    you feel about that woman and her baby --
  - Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
  - Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with
    a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
- - Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
  - Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
- - So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
  - I get it. You can drop it now.
  - Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
  - No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
  - Ha! Where's that?
  - The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
- - What's happened to you?
  - You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me",
    but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
  - I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your
    case.
  - Why's that?
  - Because you're... different.
  - Different? How?
  - Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
  - Yeah?
  - On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
  - Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
- - You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
  - I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until
    now, and why I never will again.
  - I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls
    swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
  - I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to
    prove it to you.
  - Oh? There's proof now?
  - Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
  - Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
  - Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you
    hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
- - I just thought you should know.
  - Know what?
  - That I didn't leave you there to rot.
- - There's one major hole in your story.
  - Which is?
  - There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin'
    sorority.
- - Sure you don't want your wallet?
  - Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
  - Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up
    in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
  - I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
  - Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why
    don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny
    wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
- - Where are we going?
  - We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
  - Stop! Take me back!
- - You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
  - He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
- - Is something the matter?
  - Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
- - Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been
    different between the two of us?
  - Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
  - I was?
  - That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
  - I don't get it.
  - When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with.
    I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
  - I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
  - It's crossed my mind from time to time.
  - And...?
  - Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can
    play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love
    -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous
    nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial
    plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
  - Then you think it might have worked out?
  - Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend.
    And there it ends.
- - Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
  - I thought you were a December baby.
  - This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
- - It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through
    the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's
    clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
  - Like Ozzy.
- - Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the
    worm's memories.
  - That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
- - You really think he wanted to kill you?
  - All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
- - I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my
    clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
  - What the fuck are you doing?
  - Shhh! I need quiet for this.
- - Are you stupid or what?
  - What?
  - Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when
    some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
- - Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
  - Huh?
  - Fuck off, frat boy.
- - Get out. Both of you.
  - Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
- - Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
  - You know my father?
- - Dad lives here?
  - Not in this wing, actually. No.
- - Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think
    of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish.
    Understand?
  - Yes.
  - Where are you now?
  - I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
  - Are you hurting her?
  - No, protecting her.
- - Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
  - I see a car.
- - Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely
    safe.
  - I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
  - The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But
    now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
  - It's coming... argh! I can't!
- - It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
  - Are you sure? Not even with my father?
- - This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the
    cerebral cortex.
  - Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
- - Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
  - Where are my goddamn books?
  - Books?
  - My journals! Where are they?
- - Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes
    with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
  - But I... I need those books.
  - You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though
    he never had one.
  - Photos?
- - Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
  - Can you protect me?
  - Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put
    your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
- - You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious
    ways?"
  - Straight up.
  - Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
  - Shit. I knew you were crazy.
  - I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
- - So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
  - You need to see the prison shrink, man.
- - Just tell me if anything weird happens.
  - Weirder than this?
  - Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
- - What did you see? What did it look like?
  - Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
  - So you believe me?
- - We're gonna be late again.
  - When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
  - We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
- - Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
  - Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
- - Darn it!
  - Um... can dad come this time?
  - You know the answer to that.
  - Can't he come out for one day?
  - We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
  - But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
- - All the dads are gonna be there.
  - I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
  - No.
  - Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel
    terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
- - I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't
    make any more bad pictures!
  - You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
- - That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background
    in memory loss.
  - My father has a bad memory, too?
- - These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
  - Great. I'll see you soon.
- - What happened?
  - Honey. What were you doing with that?
  - I... I don't remember.
- - Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine,
    okay?
  - Okay.
- - I don't know... I don't remember.
  - Something must've happened! What set him off?
  - I... I blacked out.
  - Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
- - Please, mom. People will talk.
  - I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all
    of your classes.
  - Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
  - Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area
    where his memory never failed him.
  - Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after
    he blacked it out for the first time?
- - Why do you ask?
  - No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he
    was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
  - When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out
    a trick to remember the past.
- - I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might
    only have thought he actually remembered them...
  - Sure...
  - And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that
    he could...
  - What? What could he do?
- - '...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He''s sure he can get you off
    on self-defense, so if you''re patient.'
  - How long will I be in here?
  - I don't know. These things take time.
  - How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
- - I found these. The others are still in storage.
  - Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
  - Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your
    case right now.
- - Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
  - Cute, Evan.
- - What does that mean for Evan?
  - He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my
    brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
- - There must be a way to fix this.
  - Fix?
  - I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even
    got the chance to write it.
- - You're. Acting. Like your father.
  - Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean
    that I'm nuts.
- - How. Did you. Know that?
  - You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
- - Just. Like. Jason.
  - Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
- - And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
  - Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if
    Evan's inherited his father's condition?
  - Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary
    tests, see what we can rule out.
- - Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
  - Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something
    else you can try to monitor his memory.
  - Anything.
  - A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
  - Why? What for?
  - It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new
    the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
- - Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in
    the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
  - And the bad news?
  - Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
  - But you must have something to go on?
  - If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
  - But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
  - Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father.
    Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
  - Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
  - You'd be surprised how often they are.
  - Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
  - It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives
    for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit
    and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
  - How soon?...
- - Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
  - Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
- - Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
  - So what did you find.
- - No dances, just tell me.
  - The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he
    still has use of his motor functions.
- - Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
  - I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
- - I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
  - What is it?
  - Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when
    they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
- - Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have
    the picture?
  - Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning
    it...
  - What?
  - When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
- - We can't stop!
  - They've tricked us.
  - What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
  - The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
  - Who would do such a thing?
  - Exactly.
- - I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
  - No English lord would trust an Irishman!
- - Fine speech. Now what do we do?
  - Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
- - Come, it'll help you sleep.
  - Aye. But it won't let me dream.
- - Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles.
    Much to risk.
  - And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
  - No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share
    allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies
    on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
  - We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
- - I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
  - Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the
    throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your
    arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they
    respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And
    so would I.
- - War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring
    what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king.
    We need you.
  - I am trying.
  - Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe?
    Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the
    strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
  - I must... consult with my father.
  - And I will consult with mine.
- - I am the Princess of Wales.
  - Wife of Edward, the king's son?
- - I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
  - It's battle I want, not talk.
  - But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
- - I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
  - I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
  - Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's
    nephew, my husband's own cousin?
  - York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin
    hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
  - That is not possible.
- - Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest,
    so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your
    attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand
    pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
  - A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
  - Peace is made is such ways.
  - SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
- - I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
  - She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English
    lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
- - A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware
    of it.
  - It does me good to see you.
- - Why did you?
  - Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
- - You have... you have a husband.
  - I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn
    to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
- - You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne,
    though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will
    rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but
    with that of a true king?
  - I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
  - No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love
    me... because I love you?
- - M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
  - Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that
    he might show you mercy.
  - Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule
    ourselves?
  - Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows
    what can happen, if you can only live.
  - If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
- - You will die! It will be awful!
  - Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
- - Drink this! It will dull your pain.
  - It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail,
    then Longshanks will have broken me.
  - I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
- - When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos.
    Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
  - How do you know this?
  - Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
  - He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
  - Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
- - This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
  - A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut
    the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
- - Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating
    the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his
    wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place!
    Now that is romance, Oui?
  - '...I wouldn''t know.'
- - I'm dreaming.
  - Yes, you are. And you must wake.
  - I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
  - And I with you. But you must wake.
  - I need you so much! I love you!
  - Wake up, William. Wake up!
- - Your father doesn't like me, does he?
  - It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces
    don't seem to live for very long.
  - Thank you for accepting.
  - Thank you for inviting.
  - I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
  - You are. And I'll come again.
- - You've been here before?
  - Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night
    to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the
    adventure.
  - Did it work?
  - No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
- - I want... to marry you!
  - I... accept your proposal!
  - I'm not just saying it!
  - Nor I!
  - But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
  - You scare me.
  - I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like
    this one.
  - This night is too beautiful to have again.
  - I will be with you, like this. Forever.
- - I've missed you.
  - Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
  - Tonight then.
  - My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
- - Then when?
  - '...Tonight!'
- - Treason. Against whom?
  - Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
  - Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
  - It matters not, he is thy king!
  - -- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot
    commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
  - Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by
    pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
  - I do not confess.
  - Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I
    promise you'll beg for the axe.
- - Where is my son?
  - Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
- - I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
  - Shall I leave, M'lord?
  - If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
- - My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
  - No. He did not.
  - Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
  - He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough
    to come fight him.
  - You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
  - '...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M''lord.'
  - The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has
    worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
  - Humbly, M'lord.
- - No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
  - This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
  - Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to
    those you mean to rule.
  - My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
- - I have faced him. Have you?
  - Let her speak.
  - He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace.
    So grant them.
- - I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
  - He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
  - So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
  - He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
  - We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved
    your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!...
    Yet you grieve.
  - In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
  - All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we
    make.
- - All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance
    to kill Englishmen?
  - Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
  - In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The
    Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
- - Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except
    I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
  - A common thief.
  - A patriot!
- - We must run in different directions!
  - We don't split up!
  - They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
- - They're coming!
  - How many?
  - Three, maybe more!
  - Armed?
  - They're English soldiers, ain't they?
  - With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
  - It's up to us, Hamish!
- - Wanna stay with me tonight?
  - I wanna have supper waitin'.
  - We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
  - Aye, we'll get 'em.
- - Test of manhood.
  - You win.
  - Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons,
    so we train with stones.
  - The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
- - I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
  - That depends on the man.
- - Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man
    with that throw?
  - I could crush you like a roach.
- - You'll move
  - I will not.
- - Good to see you again.
  - I should'a remembered the eggs.
- - I'll wait... back there.
  - Hamish, I... thank...
- - We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
  - Fourteen? --
- - The Bruce is not coming, William.
  - Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
- - Stephen ready?
  - Aye.
- - Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
  - We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
- - Rest, William.
  - I rest.
  - Your rest is making me exhausted.
- - You know it's a trap.
  - Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
  - I don't want to be a martyr.
  - Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for
    those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay
    it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
  - That's just a dream, William!
  - We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
  - Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero,
    because you think she sees you! Is that it?
  - My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with
    her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
- - Keep these. We're going too.
  - No. One of us is enough.
- - What is it?!
  - You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
  - So I did! And what was so important about it?
  - Scotland. He intends --
- - Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
  - '...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --'
  - All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
- - No, M'lord.
  - Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
- - Now, my flower, do you understand?
  - Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused,
    M'lord.
  - You may.
- - Good day to you, M'Lords.
  - You mock us with a smile?
  - I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with
    the news of renewed rebellion.
  - Wallace's followers.
  - Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every
    Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know
    a way.
- - The little cow is insane --
  - Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss
    terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me.
    Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the
    meeting, and the ambush.
- - Is it true? Wallace is captured?
  - Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father
    is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
  - When will his trial be?
  - Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
- - I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
  - You fancy him.
  - I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king...
    and win the respect of your own people.
- - Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
  - Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would
    live to know Wallace was dead.
- - Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
  - I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
- - What news of the north?
  - Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
  - While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling
    castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
  - I have ordered conscriptions...
- - Wallace has sacked York!
  - Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
- - The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
  - So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made
    a thousand.
- - Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in
    France.
  - The Scots will fight for us?
  - What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
  - But if we have not caught Wallace --
  - He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat
    cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our
    flower?
- - His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
  - You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
- - Young Robert, we are honored --
  - My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
  - Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
- - A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
  - He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings --
    and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
- - Does anyone know his politics?
  - No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols
    will kiss his ass, so we must.
- - May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
  - He was a modest man.
  - It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns
    divided for others to wear.
- - If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
  - Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
  - The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
  - That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks
    and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
- - He won't come.
  - He will. I know he will.
- - Longshanks promised!
  - You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You
    are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
- - But... what will you do?
  - I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
  - Invade?! That's impossible, it --
- - A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what
    we face.
  - We must sue for peace.
  - Peace?!
  - We cannot defeat this --
  - With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you
    nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
  - It is suicide.
- - Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
  - You've all sworn to Longshanks.
  - An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every
    man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
  - So let the council swear publicly.
  - We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's
    wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now,
    at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be
    one.
- - I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his
    hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
  - He has already agreed to come.
- - We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the
    lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
  - I don't want to leave.
  - Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
- - Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
  - It was in Latin, sir.
  - Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did
    he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum
    et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
- - What are they doing?
  - Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing
    outlawed tunes.
- - Someone dead from this household?
  - We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
  - What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited
    their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
  - My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
  - Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
  - They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any
    hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
- - Do we know what this says?
  - 'Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.'
  - What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
- - Anything?
  - No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
  - Are we locked up?
- - Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna
    try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
  - Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
- - Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years
    ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel.
    He never did. He was murdered.
  - By who?
  - His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
  - Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's
    out there...
- - We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin
    has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
  - Are we hacking or asking?
  - Yes. In that order.
  - And what about you, anything?
- - What kind of problems?
  - Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches
    -- sensitivity to light --
  - Amnesia?
  - Before this? Before Bourne? No.
- - Good luck.
  - You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming
    with us.
- - I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific
    training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
  - Am I a doctor, no, but...
  - Are you an expert in amnesia?
  - Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
  - Believed what?
  - I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
  - So he fooled you.
  - If you say so.
  - Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel
    sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
  - You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
  - You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life
    and death?
  - You mean, did I want a date?
  - Did you?
  - These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
  - Some women like Dobermans --
  - What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
  - See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This
    isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
- - I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
  - And why is that?
  - Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
- - Is it fresh?
  - It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
- - What do you think? Is he coming in?
  - I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
  - Alright...
- - Let's give him half an hour.
  - So?
  - Felt promising. It's a start.
- - Mr. Nevins?
  - Who's this?
  - Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
- - How long have you worked for the agency?
  - Me? Four years.
  - If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason
    Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in
    Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
- - I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now.
    Is that clear??
  - Yes, sir -- ma'am...
  - I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call
    me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My
    mobile number is...
- - I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation
    for this buy?
  - That's where we came out.
  - It's a lot of money, Pam.
  - We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and
    comparison shop.
  - Still...
  - For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing
    more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
- - Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
  - I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved.
    And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough
    to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that
    scan?
- - Show me.
  - Here?
  - Now. Show now.
- - This is everything? Is there.
  - Is there. Is all there.
- - -- who? -- who else is here? --
  - -- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
  - -- shut up! -- just shut the --
- - We need to get in there.
  - I'm working on it.
- - -- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One
    of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
  - And the Germans can't match it?
- - Looks like he's been detained.
  - Who's going? Us?
  - There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
  - Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
- - -- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
  - -- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who
    had anything to do with Treadstone --
- - -- go -- take the van! --
  - -- the hotel -- how far? --
- - Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
  - I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
- - Alright... take it down.
  - What?
  - This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
- - We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
  - But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
- - You're sure?
  - What? The tapes?
  - Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
- - It's me.
  - Bourne?
- - What do you want?
  - I want to come in.
- - Okay, how do you want to do it?
  - I want someone I know to take me in.
  - Who?
  - There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
- - Okay, Jason, your move.
  - Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
- - Where am I?
  - Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a
    Russian prison hospital.
- - Oh, shit...
  - Careful...
- - Why am I alive?
  - Are you disappointed?
- - Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
  - What's that?
  - Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
- - Don't need it. I remember everything.
  - Sounds like a threat.
  - You didn't answer my question.
  - Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because
    we want you back on our side.
- - See that tram coming around the corner?
  - Yes.
  - Get on it.
- - I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
  - Who is Pamela Landy?
  - You hear me? I believed you.
  - IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
- - Why is she trying to kill me?
  - They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They
    know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but
    they know!
- - How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
  - What is this, a game?
  - I want to hear it from you.
- - Say it.
  - Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
  - A Russian?
  - It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I
    haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
  - Last week? When?
- - And you got to him before we could.
  - I killed him???
  - You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print,
    they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
  - I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
- - What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
  - Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
- - Why are you here, then?
  - Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what
    you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
  - Abbott?
  - He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
  - So when was I here?
  - What do you mean?
  - For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
  - No. You never worked Berlin.
  - My first job.
  - Your first assignment was Geneva.
  - That's a lie!
  - You never worked Berlin...
- - No... Jason... please...
  - I was here!
  - '...it''s not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was
    Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...'
- - Where were you, Jason? In the car.
  - Conklin up front.
  - I'll get the book.
  - No. There's nothing new.
  - You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
  - Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
  - -- it hasn't been two years --
  - -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever
    think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
- - We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something
    good.
  - I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
- - I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
  - I worry when you get like this.
  - It's just a nightmare.
  - I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
- - Sleep. Sleep now.
  - I should be better by now.
  - You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep
    having over and over.
  - But it ends up the same.
  - One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You
    and me.
- - No... How?
  - The Telegraph office.
  - But we were so careful.
  - We pushed it. We got lazy.
- - But you're sure?
  - He was at the campground yesterday.
  - So...
  - It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
- - That's crazy.
  - No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
  - Where --
  - Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
- - '...but you''re not -- you''re not sure...'
  - We can't wait to be sure.
  - I don't want to move again... I like it here.
  - Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll
    come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
  - -- where's left to go? --
  - -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
- - You drive.
  - What?
  - Switch! You drive!
  - -- where? -
  - -- make the left -- toward the bridge --
- - Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
  - -- not yet --
  - -- it's just him? --
  - -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
  - -- hang on --
- - You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
  - Where are you going?
  - I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can
    follow.
  - What if it's not who you think it is?
  - If he crosses the bridge, it is.
  - There must be another way!
  - I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
  - Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
  - There's no choice.
- - I love you, too.
  - Tell me later.
- - I wanted to kill him.
  - But you found another choice.
  - I did.
  - It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
  - It might have.
- - I know it's a dream.
  - You do?
  - I only dream about people who are dead.
- - God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
  - Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
- - I emptied it.
  - Felt a little light.
  - Drop it.
- - Front. Use your teeth.
  - Sorry. Old habits.
- - You still should've moved.
  - I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
- - So why didn't you kill me then?
  - She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
- - What do you want?
  - Conklin.
  - He's dead.
- - Try again.
  - Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
- - You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
  - I don't know.
  - Who sent you to Greece?
  - A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
  - Pamela Landy?
  - I don't know who that is.
  - What's going on in Berlin?
  - I don't know! Why would I lie?
- - She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a
    while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who
    you are...
  - I did.
- - You called it in?
  - I'm sorry.
  - How long? How long do I have --
- - -- car keys?
  - -- my coat -- but we should --
  - -- what? --
  - -- take the back -- get another car --
- - Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
  - I speak English.
- - Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's
    why I came here.
  - Okay.
- - It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
  - It's nothing. It's just a picture.
  - No. It's because you don't know how they died.
  - No, I do.
- - I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father.
    I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
  - What?
- - It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
  - Yes...
  - That's not what happened to your parents.
  - Then what?
  - I killed them.
- - It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your
    mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You
    don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
  - You killed them.
- - They loved you.  And I killed them.
  - How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
  - I don't want you to forgive me.
- - It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
  - You're a liar.
  - You know I'm not.
  - YOU'RE A LIAR!
  - Look at me.
- - I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
  - I can't let you do that either.
  - Because you're afraid!
  - No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
- - I have to go now.
  - Is this really happening?
  - I'm sorry.
- - Sir...
  - Thanks.
- - She say what time I should call?
  - The sooner the better.
- - I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out
    here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you
    on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
  - What do you have, Danny?
  - You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building.
    You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
  - And?
  - There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second
    one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing,
    it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way
    down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good
    enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
  - It was staged?
  - Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
  - Jesus...
  - Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne.
    What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
  - Keep going...
  - Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin.
    Who's been in Berlin?
  - Lots of people...
  - Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
- - Who else knows about this?
  - Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
  - Show me again...
  - Okay...
- - Treadstone.
  - Never heard of it.
  - That's not gonna fly.
  - With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
- - And what are we looking for?
  - I want to know about Treadstone.
  - To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years
    ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take
    this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
  - He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
- - Let's talk about Conklin.
  - What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
  - I want to know what happened.
  - What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the
    crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to
    snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never
    came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It
    all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
  - So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
  - I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on
    four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension,
    but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go
    to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
  - And Bourne? Where's he now?
  - Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
  - I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both
    our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing
    charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
- - '...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian
    petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We
    believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency...
    This...'
  - '...this is Conklin''s computer.'
  - '...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the
    amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.'
  - Do you know what his budget was?
  - Excuse me.
  - We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
  - May I finish?
  - Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for
    a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
  - What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
  - So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good
    name?  The man is dead.
- - Berlin!
  - I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise
    a family.
  - You don't know what you're getting into here.
  - And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every
    person that you sent to find him...
- - Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
  - Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
  - My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the
    wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate
    him.
  - Don't you want answers?
  - There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead.
    And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her
    out to this lunatic with no protection?
- - So what's he doing? You believe him?
  - It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing?
    It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne
    in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
  - Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy
    mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all
    the agencies.
- - Sorry to wake you.
  - I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
- - What?
  - They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people
    got hit the first time.
  - Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
  - Did he say anything to you?
  - No... It must have been Bourne.
- - Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
  - Don't know.
  - Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
  - I'm sorry, Ward.
- - Sit down.
  - I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
  - I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
  - '''Why'' would be enough for me.'
  - I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
  - And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
  - Why not? It was just money.
  - And Danny Zorn, what was that?
  - Had to be done.
  - No good options left?
  - In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game
    when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
  - No. You lost your way.
  - Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
- - You told me Bourne was dead.
  - There was a mistake.
  - I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're
    at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
  - Will it track back to us?
  - No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin
    look worse.
  - And the Landy woman?
  - She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She
    even found his bogus Swiss account...
  - Anything else?
- - Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me,
    Uri. One last push.
  - One last push. One.
- - Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
  - What do you mean?
  - Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
  - Save it for Bourne.
  - What?
- - He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll
    have to hurry.
  - Bourne comes here? Why?
- - John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
  - Good to know you, John.
- - The world needs dreamers, son.
  - What?
  - The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
- - Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
  - Pleasure to meet you, John.
  - Nice to meet you.
- - Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
  - No. I just have short hair.
  - Is that your chiquita?
  - No, my friend knows her.
  - She Chicano, yes?
- - You like Chicanos?
  - Sure.
- - You a good pool player.
  - Got a little lucky.
  - Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
- - I don't know.
  - She is a good looking woman.
- - Guess I'll get another Tecate.
  - Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
  - What?
  - Fight. You know.
- - No. Just pool.
  - You Hoto?
  - Fuck you. You a Hoto.
  - No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
  - Right.
- - How's the weather down there?
  - Mr. Henry?
  - Come on in!
  - It's locked.
  - No, it's not.
- - We're closed, sir.
  - Where's that guy going?
  - He left his sweater.
  - Well, I left some money in there.
  - Where?
  - In the cash register. Step away from the door.
- - Where is he? Where is Rob?
  - I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
  - You got that?
- - Where did he go?
  - Who? Applejack?
  - Why did he go that way?
  - He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
- - What's the story?
  - Can't get it. It won't...
  - What can we do?
- - Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
  - This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
  - This is no good.
- - Is he in?
  - I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
- - What do you mean grammar?
  - The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
- - The grammar?
  - Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
  - Oh, yeah.
  - You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
- - Is he good?
  - He's damn good.
- - Join the party, fellas.
  - We're just going over a few things.
- - You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would
    you like me to be there tomorrow?
  - Yes.
  - Why?
  - Well, I think --
  - No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I
    don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
- - How long do you have to go?
  - 26 weeks.
  - And what does that cover?
  - Social issues. Crime prevention.
  - Hand to hand combat?
- - Ground defense.
  - Did you hear that?
- - How you doing, Bob?
  - Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
- - You keeping out of trouble?
  - I'm trying.
  - This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
- - Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
  - He said what?
  - He said you ran away from home.
  - No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
- - How's that 700 bucks coming?
  - I'm working on it.
  - Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
- - Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
  - Yeah. Hey, Clay.
- - I might have mentioned it.
  - John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
  - I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
  - I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
  - Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
- - Well, what do you think?
  - I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
- - I'm not allowed to drive those.
  - Not even for emergencies?
  - No.
  - I thought your parents were in Italy.
  - They are.
  - So who's going to know?
  - My brother.
- - He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
  - That never would of --
  - Let's cut the bullshit.
- - If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
  - What are you talking about, Bob?
  - Can you use a coaster.
- - You stole a Trans-Am.
  - Yes. I did.
  - OK, Bob.
  - It's true, Dignan.
  - Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
  - I'll just drive my car.
- - How much could you grow? Realistically.
  - As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand
    dollars worth of weed.
  - Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
  - You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
- - If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
  - Good question.
- - Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
  - You're paranoid, Bob.
  - Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
- - What was that all about?
  - I can't believe you said that.
  - What did I say?
  - I told you he's crazy.
- - The guy is fucking insane.
  - I warned you, Dignan.
  - You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
  - No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
  - I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
  - Well, don't blame me. I told you.
  - I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
- - Where'd she go?
  - Maybe she turned.
- - I think we might of scared her.
  - Let's just go.
- - I'm going to take a look at this.
  - Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal
    situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation.
    The streets and the getaway.
  - That's my responsibility.
  - That's your domain.
  - OK.
- - Bob.
  - I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
  - What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
  - I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
- - I paid for it.
  - God DAMMIT.
- - He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here.
    It's too dangerous for him.
  - Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't
    know what you're doing.
  - Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
- - You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
  - He electrocuted someone?
  - It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of
    those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's
    dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
  - His name was Swifty?
  - Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
  - That's too bad.
  - You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least
    Swifty's did.
- - What are you doing?
  - I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
- - What happened?
  - Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
  - This is natural.
  - That's good. Keep it at forty.
  - Did we get it?
  - Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
- - How much is there?
  - Don't count it.
- - Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
  - No. I was calm.
- - You really think he'll remember you?
  - No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
- - Bob, will you please listen?
  - I don't want to talk about it.
- - I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm
    going to remember you!"
  - That's true. That would give me nightmares.
  - Bob, I've got nightmares.
- - Way to go, Bob!
  - I told you they were there.
  - So it's my fault?
- - In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's
    why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
  - There were more than that.
- - Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
  - He wouldn't move.
- - Is he chasing us?
  - I don't know.
- - I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
  - It's registered in my mother's name.
  - What the fuck possessed you?
  - You're the one who kept saying ram him.
- - Bob. Are you coming?
  - See you in a little while.
- - You can go first, Bob.
  - My brother's in jail.
  - What are you talking about?
- - The weed.
  - But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
  - They said he's a drug dealer.
- - I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have
    on Future Man?
  - Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
  - That could be anybody's.
  - They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
  - Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
  - The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
  - So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
  - I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
- - How long has he been in there?
  - I don't know.
  - Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
  - We'll have to see when we get back.
- - What do you mean get back?
  - Well, obviously, we got to go back.
  - Bob, that makes no sense.
  - Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
  - This could be a trap.
  - Come on, Dignan.
  - Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
  - I'm going back.
  - Not in that car you're not.
  - Watch me.
  - Good luck, since I got the keys.
- - Give me the keys, Dignan.
  - I can't do that, Bob.
  - Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
  - Don't threaten me, Bob.
  - Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
- - Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
  - His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
  - I know it's not.
  - You don't even know his name.
  - Yes, I do.
  - What is it?
  - Just get in the car, Bob.
  - What's his name?
  - OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future
    Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene
    of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
- - It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
  - That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
- - You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
  - Let's go.
- - Dignan.
  - Anthony. Bad news.
- - Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
  - Not bad.
  - Come on in. What you been up to?
  - Not a whole lot, Bob.
- - It's too bad about what happened on the road.
  - Yeah. It is.
- - Right. It was extremely stupid.
  - I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
  - I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
  - Man, I don't want to go into this.
- - You said 48 hours!
  - I never agreed to that.
  - Bob, you're lying!
  - Bullshit.
  - All right! Backyard! Right now!
- - Come on!
  - I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
- - It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
  - I didn't have any choice.
- - I'm sorry, Bob.
  - That's OK.
- - That's OK.
  - Look. We want you on the job.
- - Come on, Bob.
  - I know it, man. Hang on.
  - Jesus Christ.
- - Scarecrow?
  - Yeah?
- - Everything OK?
  - Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
  - It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
  - Stand by. Bird Dog?
- - I couldn't hear anything.
  - Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
- - What's wrong with Applejack?
  - He's having a heart attack or something.
  - Let's go!
- - Is he breathing?
  - I think so.
- - Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
  - I didn't think there was an alarm.
  - Take him to the car, Bob.
- - The elevator broke.
  - Where's Applejack?
  - He's stuck between two floors.
- - Applejack drove.
  - Run. Run. Let's go.
- - I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
  - What's that?
  - That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
- - Do you have your own room?
  - We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
  - Do you have your own cell?
  - No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
- - Do they let you --
  - I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
- - Hold on --
  - Here we go.
  - Wait a second --
  - Now!
- - Are you a fag?
  - You're the faggot.
- - Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
  - I don't know about that.
  - Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion
    bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
  - It seemed like a good idea at the time.
  - The one and only Little Richard.
- - There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china.
    The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten
    grand.
  - Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
  - Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
  - That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
  - We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
  - Is that Buckethead?
- - Is that him?
  - Wait a second.
- - That's Anthony.
  - That's your friend Anthony?
  - Yeah.
  - What's he doing here?
  - Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably
    got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
- - Wait. Did he see us?
  - We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
- - Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did
    you use this same car, Applejack?
  - Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
- - I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
  - Well, this isn't really a party per se.
  - You don't celebrate til it's over.
  - True.
- - What?
  - Bob! Get back in position!
- - Nice to meet you, Applejack.
  - You're Anthony?
  - Yeah.
  - I hear you're a good thief.
- - Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
  - Uh-uh.
  - S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
  - Uh-uh.
- - Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
  - Abdul-Shabazz?
- - I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
  - What do you mean?
  - Feel this.
- - Where'd they come from?
  - The front stairs.
  - Where were you?
- - How do you say nineteen?
  - Dies y nueve.
  - Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
- - Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
  - No.
  - It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't
    want to scare you.
- - Were you born in Mexico?
  - Cuba.
  - Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
- - Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
  - God, yes. Like silk.
- - What?  What?
  - Like silk?
  - God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really
    kind of does.
- - Future Man.
  - Who?
  - Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
- - Did you ever steal a car before?
  - Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops.
    That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
- - What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
  - Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
- - In your backyard? How do you protect them?
  - It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
  - Hector woudn't do anything.
  - But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
- - Could you grow cinnamon?
  - I don't know. Sure, I guess.
  - You could make your own cinnamon toast.
- - Let them fight.
  - Let them fight.
- - Are you serious?
  - Yeah. He said that.
- - See you.
  - See you, Bob.
- - You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
  - What was that?
- - What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
  - There's a million places to hide around here.
  - Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
  - I hope not.
  - Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
- - Where you going?
  - Move.
- - Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
  - I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
  - Nobody does.
- - Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
  - OK, Dad.
- - You think he got my license plates?
  - He looked too shaken-up.
- - How long are they going to hold him?
  - I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in
    jail.
- - Anthony, I --
  - And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All
    right?
- - What?
  - Is that OK?
- - Bob, where you going?
  - I'm not playing any more golf.
  - Why not?
  - Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
  - You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this
    game.
  - You think I'm improving?
  - Yes. You just got to stick with it.
- - You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
  - No, I don't mind.
  - I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your
    fault.
  - Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
- - It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC.
    Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
  - That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
  - I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
- - At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was
    in custody so long. Sixty days.
  - Sixty days?
  - Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're
    drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
  - Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
  - Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
- - I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
  - Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
  - Were you adopted, Bob?
  - Why do you say that?
  - Well, because you guys don't look alike.
  - No. I wasn't adopted.
- - Was Future Man adopted?
  - Jesus Christ! No.
- - Let's not even talk about it.
  - It was stupid.
- - Yeah. Let's keep it --
  - Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
- - Give him a second.
  - Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
- - You OK, Bob?
  - No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
  - Nothing. I was just asking.
- - No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
  - Sure.
- - What are you doing?
  - My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
  - Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
  - No.
- - Jesus, Bob.
  - I didn't do anything.
- - Yeah.
  - Who's got the car keys?
- - We think Mr. Henry maybe --
  - His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
- - It's in the driveway.
  - Temporarily.
- - This is my business manager, Rowboat.
  - Nice to meet you.
  - That's a sharp jacket.
  - Thanks.
- - It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
  - It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play.
    Hold it like this.
- - You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
  - Thanks.
- - 'Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How
    did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts.
    Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ''s sake:
    you got to know your grammar.'
  - Grammar.
- - You mean like techniques?
  - Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five
    percent. Do you believe that?
- - I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
  - Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect
    of your job?
- - You mean a safecracker?
  - 'Yeah. And I''ll tell you who we''re going to want: Kumar Banijamali.'
- - Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself
    go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
  - So do I.
- - Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
  - I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
  - I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
  - What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
  - Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently.
    But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
  - I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think
    an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
  - As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting
    my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom.
    Dignan's not going to make it.
- - And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
  - Hold it.
- - Congratulations. You passed the test.
  - What do you mean?
  - The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
- - That was a test?
  - Take a deep breath.
- - How does that feel?
  - It feels good.
- - Did Dignan take the test?
  - Yes, he did.
  - How'd he do?
- - Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a
    liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
  - That sounds like Dignan.
- - I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean?
    What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
  - Me?
  - No, that door over there.
  - I don't want to die.
  - Are you afraid?
  - Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of
    go, Woah. Man.
  - Exactly. Woah.
  - Death.
  - The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
  - No. Bob did.
  - Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
  - Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
  - Anthony, I'm petrified.
- - This is good.
  - I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten,
    make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
- - But you're thieves. It's what you are.
  - Yeah.
  - It's an esoteric journey.
- - We're renegades from despair.
  - Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
  - Absolutely.
  - Why'd you want to help us?
  - Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
- - What color hair does he have?
  - Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
  - Making Hutch David Soul?
  - Right. The blond guy.
  - OK. That's wrong.
  - Dignan, it's --
  - Plus where's Huggie Bear?
  - He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
  - I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
  - No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling
    different pay phones.
- - Why?
  - As part of his plan. I don't know why.
  - See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
  - The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
  - What does Starsky say?
  - He says. This is he.
  - This is he?
  - No. This is he.
- - Did you see what I meant about the window?
  - Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
  - That's true. But what if they change the locks?
  - Would they do that?
  - Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
- - Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
  - See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength
    would be --
- - She's really kind of hot.
  - She's an attractive older woman.
- - It's got a V-8, Dignan.
  - What do you think the cops have?
- - Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than
    what it's appraised at.
  - But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
  - I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are
    worth three times that.
- - The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things
    Dignan was not supposed to touch."
  - Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
  - That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her
    birthday. They have a very special value for her.
  - Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's
    just not time for it.
  - Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house.
    Did you ever think of that?
- - Where are you going?
  - I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
  - How was I ridiculing you?
  - You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom
    and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
  - That's not what I meant, Dignan.
- - Did you see that?
  - Yeah, I saw it.
  - I'm lookout.
  - Dignan, it's got an alarm.
  - I don't think so. Just reach on in.
  - That sets it off.
  - No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
- - It had an alarm.
  - Yeah, I heard that.
  - Five, seven, eight dollars.
- - Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
  - Eight dollars.
  - That's not bad.
- - But he didn't say anything.
  - Hang on a second.
- - Is it back in?
  - Yeah.
- - Loop around real fast.
  - Just turn right here.
- - OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just
    in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
  - You think we're going to be chased?
  - That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However,
    I will say --
- - Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What
    are you doing? Anthony!
  - Nothing. Go ahead.
- - Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
  - No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
- - Dignan, calm down.
  - You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
  - Dignan! Stop!
- - Calm down. Take a deep breath.
  - You're right. You're right.
- - Where's the manager?
  - Where's the other stocker?
  - There's another stocker, right?
  - We know there's another stocker.
- - Is that the manager?
  - Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
- - Holy shit.
  - We got it. We got it.
- - What about what that guy said?
  - Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me.
    Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
- - I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
  - Like he meant it.
  - Yeah.
  - Like he would find Dignan. One day.
  - Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
- - What's wrong with him?
  - What do you think?
  - Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
  - He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
  - I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the
    plans, you're actually lucky you got --
  - Don't even say it, man.
- - Can I get that credit card from you?
  - I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
  - Why not?
  - Because my mom gets the bill.
  - She's not going to notice, Anthony.
  - I don't want to use it.
  - Well, then cut it in half.
  - I keep it for emergencies.
  - Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
- - See if mine are in there.
  - Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
  - Yes, they are.
  - Look at the treads on those.
  - What about them?
  - They obviously weren't designed for racing.
  - Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
- - Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
  - You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan
    used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
  - That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any
    $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
  - Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
  - You were spoiled rotten.
- - I'll just say it.
  - I'll say it.
  - OK. Go ahead.
  - On your marks...  Get set go.
- - You owe me fifty bucks.
  - Bob?
- - Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
  - No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
  - It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
- - Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
  - I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
  - Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
  - It's not a plan. It's just --
  - Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole
    cover and blow it up as it went over.
  - Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
  - True.
- - Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
  - Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities.
    Especially after Bob crashed the car.
- - No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
  - Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us
    in prison or not?
- - I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
  - No. We didn't.
- - This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
  - Hi.
  - Inez, this is --
  - Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
- - May I have a word with you, please?
  - Sure.
- - What the fuck is going on here?
  - What. What's the matter?
  - Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real
    name?
  - No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
  - They don't?
  - No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
  - Which one was that?
  - On the left.
- - She's from Cuba.
  - No kidding.
- - He needs to hire an attorney.
  - No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
- - Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make
    sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
  - As long as he gets out OK.
  - Obviously. That's a given.
  - Bob?
- - See, now we've got a plan.
  - Don't worry about it, Bob.
- - See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's
    house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive
    in and save him.
  - This was in fourth grade.
  - Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before,
    but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking
    out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
  - After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
  - They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's
    life.
- - But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
  - Yes... It's true.
- - He's gone. He stole the car.
  - Where was it parked?
  - Right here.
- - That coward. Son of a bitch.
  - Maybe he just went to the store.
  - He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it.
    Bob doesn't have any character.
- - He went back for his brother.
  - We said 48 hours.
  - That's a long time to be in jail.
- - When'd he tell you?
  - This morning.
  - Where was I?
  - You were asleep.
  - He told you and you let him do it.
  - He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
  - If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
  - Well, I didn't do it, did I?
  - So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was
    just an act. You were just --
  - Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
  - I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
  - If you say so.
- - If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd
    be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
  - I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself,
    Dignan.
  - Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
- - We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
  - No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
- - Why don't you come with us.
  - OK.
- - I can't believe he just jumped you.
  - Can you hand me those french fries.
- - I wish I'd been there.
  - Would of been nice.
- - Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
  - I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting
    the fuck out of this place.
  - We need a car.
- - I have an idea for that.
  - What?
  - Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
  - I don't think we can do that.
  - I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
  - What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
  - She doesn't need to know.
  - I don't know, Dignan. I just --
  - Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here.
    Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
  - Shh.
  - No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something
    better --
  - Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
- - I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
  - You don't know how to hotwire.
  - Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
  - Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
  - No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
- - I think we better go home.
  - Don't panic, Anthony.
  - I'm not. But there's --
  - You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough
    dough to --
  - Our money situation is not good.
  - You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
  - We've got sixteen dollars.
  - That's not correct.
- - Sixteen dollars.
  - I know.
  - Where's the rest?
- - I had to give some to Inez.
  - How much?
  - $383.
- - You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
  - She needed it.
  - A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
  - Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
  - That's what she is!
  - I know that. But --
  - You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
  - Shut up!
  - What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats!
    And go around scrubbing the --
- - When'd you get back?
  - Ah. Couple days ago.
- - Who's in the car?
  - That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
  - Sure.
- - Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
  - You really hit a guy with a bottle?
- - I want you to look at this.
  - What is it?
  - It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
  - What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
- - Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
  - Who's Mr. Henry?
  - You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
- - What exactly is this place? Freezers?
  - Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
- - What time did he say to be here?
  - Right now.
- - You could give somebody a concussion.
  - Let me feel that.
- - What do you think?
  - He seems pretty good.
- - Dignan. Take it easy.
  - Bob!
- - He doesn't want to fight.
  - Get out of the way.
  - No, Dignan. This isn't --
- - No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
  - Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
- - Shit, Dignan.
  - What the fuck are we doing out here?
  - I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
  - I'm sorry, Bob.
- - OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van.
    What time is it?
  - Eleven fifteen.
  - OK. Mark that down.
  - I did.
- - God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker.
    Good friends with Mr. Henry.
  - Yeah. It's pretty good.
  - It's like we've finally arrived.
- - Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
  - Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
- - Or I might end up with a broken nose.
  - Did that hurt?
- - I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
  - I don't think you will.
  - I don't want to be too much of a liability.
  - Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
  - I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were
    after that Swifty stuff happened.
- - He was a nice guy.
  - He was all right.
- - Do you like Inez?
  - As a person?
  - Yeah. As a girl.
  - Yes. I do.
  - So do I.
- - Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
  - Go ahead, Bird Dog.
  - You're all clear.
  - Roger.
  - We all set?
  - Hang on a second.
- - Uh-huh?
  - Take your second position.
  - OK. Roger.
- - I'm in position, Scarecrow.
  - Any activity?
  - Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
  - Good. It's supposed to be.
  - I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
  - Stand by, Bird Dog.
- - I don't know.
  - Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
- - What's happening? What's going on?
  - It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
- - Who did that? What the fuck is that?
  - It's going back down.
  - Applejack! What's happening?
- - Freeze!
  - Nobody move!
  - Get against the wall!
- - Help me move him.
  - Careful. Check his pulse.
- - Who tripped the alarm?
  - It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
  - Where's Kumar?
  - I don't know.
  - Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
- - What are you doing?
  - Let's go. Come on.
- - Wait for Kumar.
  - Come on, Kumar.
- - You're kidding.
  - Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
- - Come on.
  - I'll see you there.
  - What?
  - I'll see you there.
  - What are you talking about?
  - I'll get him.
  - There's not enough time.
  - Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
- - Dignan, it's too late.
  - I don't think so.
- - Like amnesia.
  - Can't remember shit. CRS.
- - So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
  - I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
  - He did?
  - Yeah.
  - You got to be kidding me.
  - I'm not kidding.
  - What'd he get?
  - Pretty much everything.
  - The grandfather clock?
- - You think Applejack knew?
  - We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got
    dismissed.
- - Why?
  - We're not sure.
- - Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
  - What do you mean?
  - Nothing.
- - You're living on a sailboat?
  - It belongs to Bob's uncle.
  - How big is it?
  - Oh, I'd say about --
- - Where?
  - Behind Bob's house.
- - Does it float?
  - We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
- - So how is it in there?
  - What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when
    you want to.
- - What's he in for?
  - He stole a tractor.
- - I think I may have found a way out of here.
  - You're kidding.
  - No. I'm not.
  - How?
  - Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
  - Dignan, I --
- - When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower
    guard.
  - What?
  - Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
  - Dignan, I --
- - 'Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man''s land. And Bob. Remember:'
  - Scale the --
  - Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
- - Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
  - Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
  - Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
- - I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
  - Fuck you Vincenzo.
  - Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
  - I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you
    busted into Viva Las Vegas.
- - Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
  - Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
- - Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
  - Yeah boss?
- - I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around
    telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
  - The... The funny man.
  - The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a
    real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
  - Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh!
    Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds
    a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's
    a ni... he's a black guy.
  - He's a nigger.
  - Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my
    mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but
    he's gonna give all the black guys...
- - Continue the joke.
  - He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me
    half to death."
- - You gonna do what I say, got it?
  - Yes.
  - I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
  - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
  - Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
- - Don't do this my son.
  - Open it!
  - Have you no fear of God?
  - That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
- - Father, I'll do you right here.
  - God have mercy on my soul.
- - Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
  - What do you want me to say?
  - Just be natural, goddamit.
  - How long since your last confession, my son?
- - I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound.
    You can't talk about this... to anyone.
  - Just go!
- - Hello? You there?
  - Y-Yes my son.
- - Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
  - Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
  - What is it my son?
  - It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and
    loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these
    two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission.
    But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
  - God's permission? God doesn't...
- - But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is...
    correct.
  - You believe?
  - Yes.
  - You feel?
  - Yes.
  - You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong.
    It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers
    would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The
    Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
- - Has he now?
  - You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs
    and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
  - I guess not.
  - It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from
    God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
- - You're right.
  - Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
  - I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
  - Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
  - I believe these young men are right.
  - You know them personally?
  - Yes.
  - Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
  - No. They would never do that.
- - The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
  - Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to
    hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
  - Forgive me father.
  - Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
- - Right now.
  - Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny
    man... the funny.
- - This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's
    so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and
    fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to
    get me, y'know?
  - Hallelujah, Jaffar.
  - So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps
    and drug dealers and all that shit?
- - Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
  - We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
- - You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
  - Who says that? You could take credit on it.
  - What are you serious?
  - Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell
    him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
- - Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
  - Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
  - Fuck you!
  - Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You
    are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
  - Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
- - Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the
    last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
  - I'll be back at 9:00.
- - Hello?
  - Hey Murph.
  - Roc. You okay?
  - Yeah. Anybody call for me?
  - No. You sure you're okay?
  - I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
- - Hello?
  - Hey, Murph.
  - Roc. You okay?
  - Yeah. Anybody call for me?
  - No. You sure you're okay?
  - I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
- - Hurry the fuck up!
  - This is some crazy shit, man!
  - Those cocksuckers sold me out!
- - Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
  - You sure you killed them?
- - Liberating isn't it?
  - Y'know it is, a bit.
- - Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set
    me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good
    as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in
    the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
  - So?
  - So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your
    new thing right?
- - Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
  - Well, what'ya do?
- - You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
  - Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be
    professional, but no...
- - Worst day of my life, man.
  - Well, I'm sold.
- - Well he sure as fuck knew you!
  - Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
- - Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
  - What the fuck do you mean?
  - I mean he ain't here.
- - You bet your ass he will.
  - Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
- - Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
  - We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
- - We'll keep going, Roc.
  - You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
- - What the...?
  - I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
- - Oh my god!
  - I...
- - Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
  - Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
- - It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless
    relatives down at the Anvil.
  - Just called ta torture us did ya?
- - But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt
    all night, poor girl.
  - Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women
    the way Connor does.
- - Promise me boys.
  - We promise.
- - That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a
    guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those.
    I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of
    these turning up.
  - Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking
    notch.  What's your name?
  - Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
- - Who the...
  - Twist of lemon!
  - Chief, what the fuck is this?
  - Sweet-n-low!
- - He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
  - Why do you always disrespect me like that?
  - Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me
    around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
- - How many bodies, Greenly?
  - Eight.
- - While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
  - Shit! Shit!
- - Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
  - It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came
    in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they,
    Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
- - After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle
    booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
  - Witness?
  - No way they could have seen it.
- - They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
  - Who were the victims?
  - A couple of peons for the mob and...
  - Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping
    dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police
    doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad
    car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements.
    NOW!
- - What if it was just one guy with six guns?
  - Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
- - So what are you thinkin' here?
  - Really want to know?
- - So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
  - These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he
    was the...
  - The what man?
  - The fat man.
  - Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do
    you base this upon?
  - He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
  - And the pennies?
  - New hitman wants to leave his mark
  - That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound
    theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another
    possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
  - Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
  - The Greeks. The Italians.
  - The Sicilians.
- - The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and
    exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number
    one... Duffy.
  - They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
  - Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
- - Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did
    one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again
    the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some
    iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
  - What about one guy with two guns?
  - Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to
    the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his
    elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed
    eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way.
    Had to be at least two.
- - Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told
    you?
  - It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
  - And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought
    about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and
    let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal
    and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury
    it from here on out.
- - Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as
    I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the
    booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits
    the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little
    fireman time.
  - No way they could have seen it?
  - Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep
    hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right
    through the glass. Why?
- - Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped
    me out.
  - What?
  - A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a
    coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
  - Why was I not informed of this?
- - These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours
    apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
  - Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just
    ran out of bullets.
  - Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with
    intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty
    good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
  - Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
  - Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions
    at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in
    the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary,
    even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me
    a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
- - No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
  - Rocco!
- - What?
  - Where's my cat?
  - I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
  - You... oh god, why?
  - I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
  - You killed my... my...
- - Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
  - My, my...
  - Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name!
    Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...
  - Pee...Per...Man.
  - Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
  - It was... It was...
  - Male or female, bitch?!!
- - Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
  - Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
- - And number three, Dolly.
  - Uh... two shooters!
  - Fan-fuckin-tastic!
- - So, what do we do now?
  - That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
- - She was in here when it went down.
  - Can she I.D. them?
  - They were wearing masks.
  - Of course they were. How many?
  - Three.
- - Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
  - Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides,
    if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's
    no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit.
    Something... new is going on here.
- - Maybe the three of them had something in common.
  - No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
- - And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
  - That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
- - The shooter knew these guys, huh?
  - How do you figure?
  - Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
- - I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
  - Okay then... let's get ya started.
- - Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb
    here is...
  - Rule of thumb?
  - Yeah?
  - Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men
    to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
- - I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman.
    I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
  - Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
- - Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
  - Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
- - I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
  - Aye.
- - Hey Murphy?
  - Aye.
  - How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
  - How many?
  - Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
- - No fuckin' hot water man. That...
  - Shut it. It's Ma.
- - Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
  - Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
- - Oh, Jesus.
  - I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
  - Don't even do it, ya bastard.
  - He got beat up by a girl.
  - If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative
    for Christ sakes.
- - All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
  - Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
- - '"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"'
  - '"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."'
  - Okay. We're ready.
- - A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
  - Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
- - Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard
    asses, do ya?
  - Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up
    a stool and have a drink with us?
- - '"Now, that wasn''t too polite, was it?"'
  - '"I''m afraid we can''t let that one go, Ivan."'
- - How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
  - Italian.
- - I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
  - German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to
    cops. Period.
  - Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
- - Absolutely not.
  - No pictures, either.
- - Destroy all that which is evil...
  - '...so that which is good may flourish'
- - Know what we need, man?... some rope.
  - For what?
  - Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
  - What?
  - Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and
    they always end up using it.
  - Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
  - I'm serious.
  - Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
  - I don't know they just always need it.
  - What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
- - Is that right, Rambo?
  - All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
- - Nervous?
  - A bit.
  - Me, too.
- - See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
  - Just like on TV.
- - Where the fuck are you going?
  - We'll find it. Just calm down.
  - No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid
    thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
- - We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
  - Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us
    lost!
  - Sh, sh! Fuck you!
- - That was way easier than I thought.
  - Aye.
  - On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
  - Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
  - Oh, we're good man.
  - Yes, we are.
- - Nine bodies.
  - Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny
    man?
- - Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
  - Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their
    front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill
    those motherfuckers.
  - Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
- - Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
  - Yes.
  - Then what the fuck?
- - Who did you kill?
  - Holy shit. Who? How many?
- - So what do you think?
  - I'm strangely comfortable with it.
- - We've teamed up with a sex offender.
  - So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
- - Give the guy a shot.
  - Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or
    remorse. Evil man, dead man.
- - There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light?
    Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
  - A-fuckin'-men!
- - That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
  - And he is one smart man.
- - He isn't to be touched.
  - He's a good man.
- - Now, you will receive us.
  - We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
  - We do not want your tired and sick.
  - It is your corrupt we claim.
  - It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
  - With every breath we shall hunt them down.
  - Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
  - Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of
    every faith can embrace.
  - These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore
    them will pay the dearest cost.
  - There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push
    the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
  - For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three.
    And on that day you will reap it.
  - And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
- - We're alive.
  - An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left
    me this.
- - What are you going to do?
  - We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
  - y-y-yeah that's what he said.
- - Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
  - Right.
- - Would someone please come over here and...
  - Fuck!
  - me up the...
  - Ass!
- - You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from
    before, huh?
  - We... met them last night.
  - They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
- - So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
  - We paid attention in school.
  - Know any other languages?
- - Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
  - Our mother can see through bags.
- - Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he
    had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
  - So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking
    citizen?
  - I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
  - I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
  - We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then
    we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
  - Be careful.
  - I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
- - Hello.
  - Connor, is that you?
- - Mother, is that you?
  - Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
  - Ma, what's wrong?
- - It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would
    bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to
    remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was
    wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
  - Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
- - I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
  - What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
- - What?! What are you doin'?
  - I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
  - Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
- - No ma! No!
  - BLAME...
- - How's Uncle Sibeal?
  - Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit
    on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know
    he can't bear ta charge us.
- - Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
  - What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
  - Well, I didn't but...
- - Yeah, we promise.
  - Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that
    shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
- - Still bickerin' over that, huh?
  - Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
  - All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
- - Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as
    back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the
    funny fuckin' man!
  - Where's your gun?
  - Chest pocket.  Shit!
  - This is a six-shooter.
- - Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good
    job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
  - Let's do him right here.
- - What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this
    fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
  - Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
- - What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT
    FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
  - Get a hold of yourself, man.
- - Anybody you think is evil?
  - Yes.
  - Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
  - Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go
    home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and
    child molesters all getting out of prison.
- - Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
  - Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards
    since I was in high school and look at this place.
- - Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
  - Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag.
    Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
  - You sound real remorseful.
- - She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
  - Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
  - What?
  - Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that
    room?
  - What are you saying?
  - Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
  - You think they sold me out? No way.
  - He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but
    he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead
    on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause
    as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing?
    A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
  - No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't
    just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and
    beat it?
  - He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter
    woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you?
    Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
  - No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's
    bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't
    the thing of it.
  - Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
  - No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
- - Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
  - What happened?
  - I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
- - What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
  - Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
- - Anybody see ya?
  - Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
- - Yeah, well...
  - Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the
    cut? Is there a raffle or something?
- - I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
  - MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who
    they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
- - What the fuck are you doing?
  - I-I'll tip her.
- - What? What is it?
  - This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
- - Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for
    the tit thing.
  - No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
  - Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house
    of Della Rocco.
- - You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
  - Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of
    shit.
  - C'mon!
- - Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
  - Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
- - Look again for fuck sake!
  - I know what the fuck he looks like!
- - Shit.
  - What?  What, that guy?
- - They got nothing.
  - This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
- - You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
  - Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
  - Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
  - You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
- - You guys?
  - We're here brother.
  - You gotta keep going.
- - Yes sir.
  - Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings.
    45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman,
    root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a
    faucet or a drain cover or something.
- - Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
  - I can't find the second one, sir.
  - Look under the body.
  - Got it.
- - Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
  - Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
- - Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the
    protocol on this one.
  - Any tips on where these guys may be?
  - Any word back from the E.R.s?
- - Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
  - What?
  - The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you
    want to do?
  - You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
- - Lord's name.
  - Mother Mary, full of grace.
  - What did you do, Connor?
- - Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
  - Yes mother.
  - I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at
    the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell
    swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip
    over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
- - Are ya ready?
  - Aye.
- - Fuck you.
  - Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing
    around.
  - I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me
    ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took
    the wheel, who was beside you?
- - Hey, I just...
  - Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks
    for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit
    eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
  - I need Il Duce.
  - The Duke?  What did you do?
  - This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides
    to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's
    content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it.
    I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
- - Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
  - Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like
    he was a ghost or something.
  - Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went
    totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure
    you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
- - There's ways around that.
  - Go find one.
- - What did he bring him in for?
  - Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile
    away.
  - Just for him?
  - Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says
    he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
  - Up where?
  - Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something
    to do with this kid.
  - Oh fuck!
- - Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
  - Yeah, nice meetin' you.
- - What are watchin' this junk for?
  - You can change it if you want to.
  - I don't know why we have to watch TV.
  - Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
- - Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
  - Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
- - Come on out a minute, okay?
  - Okay.
- - Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right
    in front of your stupid house.
  - Stop it Mike.
  - You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
- - Yeah, how did you know?
  - I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
- - Oh yeah?
  - You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
  - Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
  - Am I bothering you?
  - No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
  - Yes.
  - How is Central these days?
  - Terrible boring.
  - What else is new? Right?
  - Yeah. What are you doing now?
  - I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
  - That's too bad.
  - What do you know about the ear? Anything?
  - Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
  - Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
  - I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right
    above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an
    ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office.
    The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think
    there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that
    could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
  - Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
  - There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this
    woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close
    to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the
    Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
  - Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
  - No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago
    some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were
    reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
  - The ear is from a missing person maybe?
  - Maybe so.
  - It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
  - Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance
    for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my
    father isn't in charge of her.
  - I guess you have to get back home soon?
  - Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
- - That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long,
    the police are watching.
  - Where are they?
  - I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
- - Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
  - I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
  - Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
  - My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared.
    Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been
    murdered.
  - You really do hear a lot, don't you?
  - Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
  - I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my
    own hours for a while, which is nice.
  - Still, it must be kinda rough.
  - It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to
    know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
- - What happened to him?
  - I don't know. He moved away.
- - I've gotta go in.
  - Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
- - I guess I'll see you sometime.
  - I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
  - Yeah. Good bye.
- - You hungry or thirsty, or both?
  - I don't know.
  - I'd like to talk to you about something.
  - Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
- - I don't want to cause any trouble.
  - I'm here, aren't I?
  - I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
  - Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
- - Alright, now tell me. What is it?
  - There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes,
    in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person
    could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and
    hide and observe.
  - You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you
    crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
  - Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you
    to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
  - It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
  - Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I
    could crawl into later.
  - Now, how are you going to do that?
  - Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig.
    I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment.
    After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from
    me and I will then jimmy a window.
  - What will I say when she comes to the door?
  - You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't
    have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
  - I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird.
    Too dangerous.
  - Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No
    one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be
    crazy enough to do something like this.
  - You've got a point there.
- - Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three
    minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
  - Alright.
  - Let's go.
- - Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
  - Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number,
    bright boy.
  - Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
  - Alright. Good luck, yourself.
- - Are you alright?
  - Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
- - I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
  - Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
  - No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
  - I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have
    time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
  - Yeah, if it opens the door.
  - Yeah.
- - So, what's next?
  - Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
  - I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
  - You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's
    Friday, do you have a date tonight?
  - Yes. I do.
  - Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a
    date, that does that.
- - You really want to do this, don't you?
  - I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went
    wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
- - I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
    Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though,
    I love Mike. What do want me to do?
  - First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
  - I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
  - Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
  - Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to
    your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
  - Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
- - What's the plan.
  - First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch
    her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she
    is there and not in her apartment.
  - Brilliant.
  - Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
  - This is not my usual Friday night!
- - That sounds good.
  - Two.
- - Here's to. An interesting experience.
  - I'll drink to that.
- - Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
  - Why not?
  - It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
  - It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should
    go home. Can you drive this car?
  - Yeah, but.
  - Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
  - OK.
  - Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
  - I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and
    have some coffee.
  - I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
  - I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
  - Oh, okay, can I call?
  - Okay, yeah, call.
  - Look, it can wait till Sunday.
  - Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going
    to wait until she's asleep?
  - Yeah.
  - I'm going to wait here until she comes.
  - Are you sure?
  - I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
- - Okay, thanks.
  - I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
  - That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you,
    okay?
  - Okay, okay. Bye.
- - Well, how did it go? What happened?
  - Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange
    people involved.
  - What did you see?
  - Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
- - What's with Mike?
  - He got a little jealous.
  - I'm sorry, I didn't...
  - It's okay. Don't worry about it.
- - You want a Dairy Queen?
  - No way. I'm about to blow up.
- - You want to tell me about it?
  - OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I
    have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son.
    I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has
    now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things
    for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive.
    There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the
    other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's
    on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
  - Wow. Should you tell my father?
  - I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information
    illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
  - You saw a lot in one night.
  - Actually. I've been in twice.
  - Twice. Without her sensing anything?
  - Yes.
  - Did you see her undressed?
  - Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
  - Yeah?
  - That doesn't bother you, does it?
  - Who, me? Why should it?
  - That's what I thought.
  - You're sure right. It is a strange world.
  - Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
  - I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world
    was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love,
    and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light
    of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any
    difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
  - Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
  - So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
  - I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place
    tomorrow with a camera.
- - No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you
    can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
  - I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
- - Okay, be careful.
  - Okay, Sandy.
- - Can I give you a kiss good night?
  - You better not, Jeffrey.
  - Okay, okay.
  - Goodnight.
  - See ya tomorrow.
- - You were late.
  - I'm really sorry.
  - What am I going to do?
  - You want to go talk to him?
  - Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk
    to him later.
- - You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
  - That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
  - Shoot.
  - Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
    Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
  - Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like
    each other.
  - Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
  - Oh yeah?
  - Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man
    with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on
    a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this.
    In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her
    legs broken.
  - Jeffrey!!
  - Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the
    dead man's place.
  - I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this.
    Are you going back to her apartment?
  - Yeah.
  - Jeffrey? Why?
  - I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.
    And it's all secret.
  - You like mysteries that much?
  - Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
- - You worry about me really?
  - Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
- - Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your
    father but you might get into trouble.
  - Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey,
    I mean it.
  - Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station,
    okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
- - Everything okay?
  - Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still
    on?
  - You didn't tell him about me?
  - No.
- - I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
  - Okay. Great!
- - Okay.
  - What is it?
  - Just some fatherly advice.
- - What was that all about?
  - Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
  - It's good to see you.
  - Where to?
  - Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more
    about what you learned?
  - I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
  - It's okay.
  - You look beautiful.
  - Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
  - I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
- - You want to dance?
  - I can't dance fast.
  - Really?
  - Really. You want to dance with someone else?
  - NO.
  - Let's wait for some slow one.
  - Just a minute.
- - You want to dance?
  - Okay.
- - Oh my God. What's wrong?
  - Frank!!!
- - My father has a gun at home.
  - No.
  - Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
- - Dorothy!... Dorothy!
  - Dorothy Vallens?
  - Yes.
- - Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have
    anything to put around her?
  - No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
  - Probably not. No. Why?
  - Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
  - Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
- - Jeffrey? What's going on?
  - Shhh. I'll tell you.
- - I should go with her, Sandy.
  - Go ahead.
  - Sandy?
  - Go ahead!
- - Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right
    away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting
    someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
  - No Jeffrey!!
  - Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
- - Look Jeffrey.
  - Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
- - Hi Dad.
  - Hey Jeff.
- - Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
  - Uh-uh.
  - Are you feeling okay?
  - Uh-uh.
- - Good to see you, son.
  - It's good to see you, Dad.
- - How ya doin' Dad?
  - Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
  - Good deal Dad.
- - No.
  - Looks like you'd make a good runner.
  - Well.
  - I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
- - No, you're right.
  - I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
  - Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
  - Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
- - Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
  - Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't
    noticed.
- - Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
  - Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait.
    Is it urgent?
  - I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
  - Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
  - Alright.
- - I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such
    a shame.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Would you like a piece of cake?
  - No. No thank you.
  - It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
  - Yeah. okay.
- - He comes over to study.
  - Yeah.
- - Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
  - Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
  - Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
- - Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
  - That sounds great!
  - Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
- - Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
  - Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
  - Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee.
    I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
- - Sandy?... Sandy, please.
  - I'll get a coat for her.
- - I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
  - For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
  - Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much.
    We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now,
    so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever
    you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work
    at the store.
  - Mom.
- - Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
  - This is it.
- - Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
  - Be right down.
- - What time are visiting hours?
  - I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk
    over; I need the car this morning.
  - Well. Okay.
  - Jeffrey, when you see your father.
  - Yeah?
  - He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
  - What?
  - It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're
    home just to see him.
  - Thanks a lot, Mom.
  - Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe
    going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
- - I'm going out for awhile.
  - Do you want the car?
  - No, I'm just gonna walk around.
  - Alright.
- - Can I use the car tonight?
  - Of course, Jeffrey.
- - God, you scared me.
  - Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
  - Nothing. I'm fine.
  - You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be
    some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when
    you got home but now it is much too late.
- - Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
  - Okay Frank.
  - What kinda beer do you like?
- - Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
  - Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
  - No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
  - There ya go.
  - Good, let's drink up.
- - Hello?
  - Speak to me Fucker.
- - No thanks.
  - No thanks. What does that mean?
  - I don't want to go.
  - Go where?
  - On a ride.
  - A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
- - Heineken.
  - FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
- - Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
  - Here's to Ben.
  - Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
- - Hey? You like to walk.
  - What?
  - Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
- - What are you lookin' at?
  - Nothing.
  - Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
- - Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight
    from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight
    from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever.
    Understand, Fuck?
  - Yes.
  - I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
- - We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and
    husband?
  - He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them
    to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he
    started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank
    loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
  - You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy
    Vallens.
  - Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
  - We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're
    okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
  - Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
- - Hello, baby.
  - Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
  - Hello, daddy.
  - My bourbon.
- - MOMMY!
  - Mommy's here.
  - Baby wants to fuck.
- - Who's this fuck?
  - He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
  - From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta
    go for a ride?
- - Where are we going, Frank?
  - Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
  - Frank?
  - You want to see him too, right?
  - Yes, but.
  - Then, shut up!
- - Look at these. What are these?
  - Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
- - Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
  - Those are my breasts.
  - Can I feel 'em?
  - If you want to.
- - Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
  - Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
- - Frank gone?
  - Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
  - Bull.
  - Alright, suit yourself.
  - He's comin' back? What for?
  - '''Cause he''s comin'' back, that''s what for. Frank''s got you really loaded
    tonight.'
  - Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't
    it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
  - Oh he forced you, huh?
  - He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that
    caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm
    supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know
    his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle,
    baby.
  - No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
  - Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
- - Yes? What is it?
  - Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
  - Oh God, that stuff stinks.
  - Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
  - Oh yeah, that's good.
- - That oughta do it.
  - Yeah.
- - GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down
    on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S
    YOUR NAME?
  - Jeffrey.

  - Jeffrey nothing.
  - You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in
    my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
  - I wanted to see you.
  - What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
  - Nobody.
  - Shit. You better tell me something.
  - I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
  - An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
  - I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything
    but see you.
  - Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
  - I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
  - The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
  - You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny.
    You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something
    in an hour. I don't remember any more.
- - That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
  - Well.
  - THEN WHAT?
  - Then you got undressed.
  - How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
  - Never before this.
  - How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed.
    I want to see you.
  - No. Come on.
  - NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
  - Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
  - No way.
- - What do you want from me?
  - I, I don't know.
  - What do you want?
- - Do you like that?
  - Yes.
- - Do you like talk like that?
  - No.
  - Lie down on the bed.
- - Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
  - Nothing. Are you alright?
  - Sure I'm alright.
  - I'll go then.
- - Don?
  - No.
  - Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
- - Thank you. honey.
  - It's okay. It's okay.
- - Do you like the way I feel?
  - Yes.
  - See my breasts? See?
- - Yes.
  - See my nipples?
  - Yes.
  - You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
- - You can hit me, if you want to.
  - No, please. I won't.
- - Do you like me?
  - Yes, I like you.
  - You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
- - I made it go down the toilet.
  - What?
- - Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was
    it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
  - Do you know?
  - No.
  - You don't?
  - No. What is happening?
  - Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where
    you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
  - Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for
    what I did. I better go.
  - Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
  - Then don't talk about killing.
  - Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go
    ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little
    secret.  I want to die.
  - Don't say that.
  - It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go
    to sleep now.
  - OK.
- - Hi, can I come in?
  - Yeah, hurry up though.
- - Why are you here. Whatiya want?
  - I, uh.
  - I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came
    from, but I like you.
  - That's not crazy. I like you too.
- - I liked being with you last night.
  - Same here.
- - Oh shit.
  - Frank? Can you stand up?
  - I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
- - Nice guy. Who's he?
  - Who's it, you mean.
- - Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
  - There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
  - I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
  - Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
- - Look.
  - No.
  - Falling.
  - No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
- - Who is Don?
  - Don? Are you in with them?
  - No. But you're in very big trouble.
  - Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
  - I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know
    where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
  - Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
  - Yes.
  - Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
  - No. I should go.
  - Please, please stay.
- - Come in.
  - Hello.
- - It used to make me laugh, but.
  - I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
  - Yes. Frank--
  - Frank is coming?
  - No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't
    hate me.
  - I sure don't hate you.
  - I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
  - That's good.
- - Do you like my body?
  - Sure I do.
- - What do you want to do?
  - I'm doing it.
  - Are you a bad boy?
  - Whatiya mean?
  - Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
  - What do you want?
  - I want you to hurt me.
  - No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some
    of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy?
    Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
  - No police!!!  No police!!
- - You like to open me, don't you?
  - Yes.
  - What if I told Frank that you opened me?
- - That wouldn't be too good, would it?
  - Frank would open you.
  - Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
  - Does that scare you?
  - Shut up.
  - Beeeee careful.
  - Come on Dorothy.
  - What if Frank came over here and found us?
- - Look, snap out of it, will ya?
  - Kiss me.
- - Do you love me?
  - Do you love me?
  - I asked first.
  - Sometimes I think I do.
  - And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
- - Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
  - Just get outta my bed.
- - I love you Don with all my heart.
  - No, it's not Don.
- - I didn't mean to hurt you.
  - Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
  - You what?
  - You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
  - There's no disease, I can tell you.
  - Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy.
    Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's
    burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I
    love you?
  - I'm glad you do.
  - There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things
    moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering
    me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
  - Dorothy. No!
  - If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's
    a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it
    getting cold.
  - You called me Jeffrey.
  - I did. Are you?
  - Yes.
  - Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
  - No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
- - I guess I should go.
  - I want you to stay with me.
  - I think I better go.
- - I'll call you.
  - Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
  - What?
  - I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
  - You look beautiful to me.
- - Oh no.
  - No.  Hi baby.
- - Yeah, it's me.
  - Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
- - Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
    hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
  - It's okay. It's okay.
  - My secret lover.
- - They hurt his head.
  - Who, Dorothy?
  - Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
- - Hold me, Don.
  - Don? Where is he?
  - HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
  - I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
  - Hold me. I'M FALLING!
- - Are you Detective Williams?
  - Yes.
  - My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom
    Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
  - Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
  - He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school.
    I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field
    behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
  - You did? A human ear?
  - Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
  - Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
- - By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask
    you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business
    with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
  - Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
  - Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
- - Come into the study a minute.
  - Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
- - Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well,
    Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting.
    I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to
    ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more
    about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details.
    Right now, though, I can't.
  - I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
  - I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
  - It must be great.
  - And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway.
    I'm sure you do understand.
- - Jeffrey?
  - Yes?
  - If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
- - These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
  - Okay.
  - Anything you can tell me?
  - The criminals are winning.
  - Is that why you say it's horrible?
  - Yes.
  - I guess you've seen some bad things.
  - Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
  - Why do you do it?
  - I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
  - Yeah. I get it.
- - What is this? What color is it?
  - Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
- - What color is it?
  - It's blue. Blue velvet.
- - Jeffrey! Come on in.
  - Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
  - Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
  - Yeah.
- - Okay?
  - Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you
    some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
- - And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo.
    I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think
    Frank has taken her husband and her son.
  - I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think
    these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug
    dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell
    you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over
    now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
  - Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
  - I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
  - Is Sandy part of this?
  - No, not at all.
  - Who knows you have these?
  - Only you and the photo lab.
  - You're all through with this now?
  - Yes sir. I sure am.
- - For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I
    can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
  - Yes sir.
- - Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
  - Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
  - Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has
    a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in
    the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
  - We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
- - Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective
    Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off
    on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
  - Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
  - Not yet.
  - Oh my God. Is her son OK?
- - Frank. Come in.
  - Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
  - Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
- - Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
  - Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank.
    Won't you sit down?
- - Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
  - Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
  - Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this
    thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't
    know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful
    fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that
    is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I
    can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
  - Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
- - To your health, Frank.
  - Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your
    fuck Frank.
  - If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
- - Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
  - EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
- - See you Tuesday, Frank.
  - Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
- - I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
  - You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
  - Yeah. How's Dad?
- - I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They
    say it can bring on illness.
  - Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
- - Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
  - No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
- - Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
  - I'm not sick.
- - Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner
    at Sandy Williams' house?
  - Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
  - Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
  - I've seen a few.
  - Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
  - Okay honey.
- - I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about
    it.
  - Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved
    by.
  - Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
- - Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
  - Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
  - Stand by. One.
- - Wolf One -- say intentions.
  - I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
  - Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
- - Tower, say again!!
  - The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
  - I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
  - Roger, Wolf One.
- - I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
  - You bet, Mom! Coming up!
- - I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
  - Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
- - I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
  - Um...uh...
- - I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
  - Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
  - Buy it from me?
  - Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
  - I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
- - Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
  - I knew you'd like him.
  - Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily
    negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining
    island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head
    of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
    worse.
- - So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
  - Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
- - Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
  - Oh, yes.
  - I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
- - Give me your hand.
  - Oh, my God...
- - But first, you have to start with the clothes!
  - Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman
    dressed like that.
- - I don't know.
  - Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
- - You're serious, aren't you?
  - What's that supposed to mean?
  - It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
  - Well, that's blunt!
  - I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
  - And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
  - I see "elegant."
  - Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
  - That's what I'm sensing.
- - Alright, I will.
  - I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
  - What do you think, Adam?
- - Well, what do you think?
  - I think...it...works.
  - Let me show you the entire trousseau!
- - How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
  - No.
- - That water's freezing!
  - He's from Alaska.
- - Just be yourself.
  - Always good advice.
  - For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
- - Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
  - Eve?!
  - Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
  - Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
- - Um... Eve?
  - It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
- - Go to the bathroom.
  - Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
- - He go back to the hotel?
  - Uh..he might of.
- - What's that mean?
  - We did not leave together.
  - Who did he leave with?
- - What's it to you?!
  - I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
  - Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
  - Those sluts!
  - Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
- - Where are you going?
  - To bed.
  - To bed?
  - Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
  - What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
- - In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four
    or five days.
  - Yes, you do.
  - And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
  - Uh, yes, you do.
  - Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
  - Yes, you do!
  - Or have perfect table manners.
  - You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have
    of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you
    were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect
    by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought
    it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
  - What?
  - He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
  - Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
  - 'Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the
    short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always
    attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible.
    That''s it! If you don''t do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes,
    the houses...'
  - Where did he get all that information?
  - From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
  - So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as
    possible.
  - He didn't leave with them.
  - Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
  - He left with Sophie.
  - What?!!
  - It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his
    ear.
  - Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
- - What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
  - You're goddamn right I am!
- - I don't think so.
  - Coward!
- - Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's
    like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
  - I know...I know. You did the right thing.
- - Oh, no!
  - What?!
- - Gay.
  - Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
- - Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
  - Fallout shelter.
- - What do you want to do with it?
  - Give it back to him.
  - And if we can't find him?
  - We'll find him.
- - What's wrong?
  - I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
  - See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
- - Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The
    toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your
    life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy
    you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
  - Have him committed.
  - Yeah! That's thinking.
  - He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice"
    is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it
    ever?
  - I don't know. I like to think so.
  - Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait
    a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where
    did you go?!
  - To get some frozen poultry.
  - Then what?
  - We came back to the house!
  - You didn't stop anywhere else?!
  - No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
  - What?!
  - An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under
    a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
  - Come on.
- - Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
  - None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit
    orchards.
  - Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
  - Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
- - Adam!!
  - Where?!
  - Stop!
- - What are you bitching about now?
  - What are you doing here?
  - I forgot some of my stuff.
  - Your stuff?  Let me see that.
- - You came back for these?
  - Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
  - This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
- - Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
  - Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well,
    I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
- - So where is your roommate, the model?
  - You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long,
    Eve.
- - Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
  - Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
- - Stop it, you two!
  - I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
- - For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
  - Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
  - Well, put it down and come in!
  - You bet, hon!
- - I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's
    prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve
    itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
  - We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something
    up for you? Did you have a coat?
- - It's time.
  - Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
- - It shuts off automatically.
  - Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
  - No.  They all do.
  - I never know anymore.
- - You hear that?!
  - Yes.
- - Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to
    be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
  - I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
  - Cheese is particularly troublesome.
  - Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
  - Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
    that?
  - Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for
    the radio.
- - How long will we have to stay down here?
  - I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
  - Days??
  - Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
  - But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
  - I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
  - Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out
    in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
  - Yes, dear!
  - As long as we've got that straight.
- - Home sweet home!
  - To you maybe.
- - What's that noise?
  - The locks.
  - The locks?
  - To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life
    that lasts thirty five years.
  - Thirty -five years!
  - Then after that it's safe.
  - It's safe.
- - To go up.
  - To go up.
- - Hi, honey! Feeling better?
  - No.
  - We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
  - All our friends...
- - Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
  - I'm not hungry.
  - Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
  - No, Calvin, you're favorite.
  - Really?
- - Maybe I've just got the creeps.
  - How could you?! This is just like home!
- - No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
  - Would you like a tranquilizer?
  - You have tranquilizers?
  - I told you! I've got everything!
- - Oh, no.
  - What?
  - Uh, oh. Now it's time.
  - Honey?
- - Is there a problem?
  - No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
  - I've noticed.
  - What shall we call him?
- - No.  I think it's just right.
  - And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
  - Yes!
  - If I...you know...
  - What? Whatever you want, Helen!
- - Calvin?!
  - Right here!
  - We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
  - Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
  - Why?
  - No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the
    bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the
    surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has
    the service elevator!
  - Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
  - Yes.  Well... yes.
- - Watch this!
  - What?
- - Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system
    match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
  - Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe
    he's a little...young for school.
  - Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
- - Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just
    the way it used to be.
  - Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
  - I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on
    the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's
    moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
- - Hi, honey!
  - Hi.
- - Calvin!
  - Coming!
- - Get the presents and do the lights.
  - You bet.
- - No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
  - And I made these!
- - What did you wish for, Adam?
  - If he tells, it won't come true!
  - Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
  - Well, we did in my family!
- - One who doesn't glow in the dark.
  - Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
  - Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
- - Let's eat our cake.
  - Yeah. Let's dig in!
- - If we still have one.
  - Yes...
  - You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you,
    hon?
  - Would you excuse me?
  - Sure.
- - In the generator room again?
  - Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
  - I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
- - Should we say a little prayer first?
  - Just open the door.
- - Yes, yes it is!
  - It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
  - Yes! That's right!
- - I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush.
    There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
  - Mutants?!
  - It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your
    ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
- - Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
  - No.
  - Yes.
  - I don't believe it!
- - They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly
    collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something
    terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I
    just can't.
  - Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
  - We stay down here.
  - We do?
  - Yes.
  - Excuse me.
- - For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
  - We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each
    other off and then--
  - No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no
    matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
  - Well, I am the head of this household--
  - I want him to at least see the sky!
  - --and we will--
  - And the ocean!  A mountain range!
  - --do as I say!
- - He's smart.
  - Yes, dear, I know.
- - And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved
    son, Adam.  Amen.
  - Amen.
- - How long will you set it for this time?
  - I thought ten years.
  - Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why
    set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
  - To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried
    about.
- - Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
  - Some time.
  - What can I offer you, Eve?
- - You got a light, honey?
  - What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
  - Good.
- - So...you...survived the blast, did you?
  - 'The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country
    boy can survive!"'
  - Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
  - '"Hell up here?"  Honey, it''s been hell up here, down there and over yonder!
    Hell everywhere.'
  - Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country
    boy?"
  - Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl,
    I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
  - Really?
  - Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you
    act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
  - No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
- - According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
  - Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
  - Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
  - What about relatives?
  - All back East.
  - The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring
    him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
  - He drank it hot?
  - Yeah.
  - Good god.
  - Yeah.
- - Oh, my God!
  - He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to
    need police assistance.
  - No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
  - I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
  - No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
  - Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's
    obvious.
  - You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever
    hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
  - And now you must let me be the judge of that!
  - I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him.
    I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
  - Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
- - Oh. A nice one, I hope.
  - Yes, ma'am.
- - Elbows, Son.
  - Sorry, Mom!
  - You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
- - Dad!
  - Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
- - He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or
    just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with
    him.
  - I'll go up.
- - I'm afraid you've got to.
  - I'll be all right.
  - You're my brave boy.
- - I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't
    get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn.
    Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
  - Yes, ma'am.
- - Right.
  - I just hope this is still good up there.
  - Mom?
- - Yes?
  - I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe
    I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just
    these last...fifteen years or so.
- - Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and
    hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow,
    the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
  - Yes, ma'am.
- - Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
  - Yes, ma'am.
  - Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for
    you - he loves you so much. We both do.
  - Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
- - '...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But
    we''ve got to hurry.'
  - Are you in trouble, son?!
  - I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
  - A psychiatrist?!
- - Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
  - What?
  - I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have
    more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
- - We have to go.
  - No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
- - This is your bedroom?
  - No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
  - Well, where are you --
  - Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
  - No.
  - Yes.
- - Hello.
  - Hi.
- - How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
  - I was thinking of selling all the cards.
  - Really? No kidding?
- - See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones,
    fives, tens. Like that.
  - I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small
    bills for the whole box.
  - Oh, that would be wonderful!
  - Well, we're here to help!
- - Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain
    again.
  - Oh, you got a problem with that?
- - I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
  - Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
- - Whatcha looking at?
  - Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
  - Say what?!
  - How do you do, ma'am.
  - I do alright.
  - Good!
- - Help you?
  - Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
- - Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
  - Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
  - Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five
    hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand
    dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
  - You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
- - Sure.
  - Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know
    where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
  - Gladly.
- - What?  What is it?!
  - The sky!!!
  - The sky?  Where?
  - Up there!!
  - I don't see anything!
  - Just look!!
- - You dial nine to get out.
  - Of what?
  - The hotel.
  - I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
- - Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
  - My father is a genius.
  - No kiddin'. Well...good night.
  - Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always
    says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night
    away from home.
  - How old are you?
  - Thirty-five.
  - You don't look thirty-five.
  - How old do I look?
  - Twenty-five? Around there.
  - I guess living up here makes people look older.
  - Up here on the fifteenth floor?
  - Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
  - Goodnight.
- - You have very nice ceilings.
  - I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
  - Not particularly.
  - Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if
    you prefer. I love sushi.
  - I love Lucy!
  - You nut!
- - It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
  - And it's called...?
  - Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
  - Really?  Since when?
- - Right on the button.
  - Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
- - That's right?
  - I've never met anyone like you in my life.
  - She's right?!
- - I've got goose-bumps all over me.
  - Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
- - Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become
    a state?
  - '1959.'
  - Who use to own it?
  - Russia.
  - When did we get it from them?
  - 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as
    well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
  - What's the capitol?
  - Juneau.
  - Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
  - Sorry, that's the largest city.
- - This must be very new.
  - Yeah.
  - It's so small.
  - What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
  - I don't think so.
  - You don't have a computer in your cabin?
  - No.
  - How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the
    highest peak?
  - Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
  - Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
  - That would knock my father out.
  - Yeah?
  - Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
  - He's a Windows guy then, huh?
  - Yes. He likes windows.
  - Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
  - '...I guess it''s...just a matter of personal taste.'
  - True.
- - Not on him.
  - I'm not wearing his pants.
  - Why not? He has great pants.
  - I just don't want to.
  - Okay.
- - Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
  - No.
- - I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
  - Almost all of them.
  - The recovery is very impressive.
  - The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
  - Amazing. I'm very impressed.
- - That's why little things mean so much to him.
  - I LOVE THIS!!
- - Why did you park way back there?
  - Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
  - Oh. I see.
- - What?!
  - Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
- - Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
  - Okay. Thank you, my friends.
- - I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
  - No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
- - Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
  - How 'bout we check with Eve first?
  - You bet!
  - So, did you buy a movie?
  - What?
  - A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
  - No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
  - I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
  - Does that work?
  - Yeah...Seems to.
- - Good-bye, Adam.
  - Goodbye.
- - Bye, Troy!
  - Bye, Adam!
  - And thanks for always being happy!
  - What?
- - This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or
    you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in
    your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite
    valuable.
  - They're pretty.  Can I have them?
  - Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
  - Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
  - You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
  - Tempus fugit!
  - En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
  - Gerade aus dann links!
  - Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
  - Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
  - You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't
    fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come
    with me.
- - These are wonderful.
  - It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
  - What's baseball?
  - It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
  - Like a painting?
  - No, son. A pitcher.
  - Like one of Mom's?
  - Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
  - The nocturnal flying mammal?
  - No. Sit down.
- - No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
  - Why?
  - Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
  - Then why go there?
  - Because he must!
- - Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
  - Blow out the candles!
- - Oh, boy! A jacket!
  - Your mom made that all by herself.
  - No kidding!
- - Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
  - Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even
    better!
  - These are really swell! I mean swell!
- - Well, do we just go on up?!
  - No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most
    cautious.
- - Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please
    excuse her French.
  - Shit is a French word?
- - C'est bon, Monsieur.
  - Merci!
- - Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
  - Yes, father?! Yes?
  - '...the pipe tobacco.'
  - Yes, sir.  Is that all?
- - Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
  - Adult Bookstore.  Why?
  - Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
  - I promise. Is that all?
  - One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
  - I'll try.
- - But, I don't understand.
  - And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
  - Well, in that case...of course, son.
- - This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's
    not Russian, is it?
  - It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
  - Uh-huh.
  - Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I
    think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it
    up in old newspapers.
  - You're sure?
  - Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War
    is over.
  - That's what everybody believes?
  - Yes, sir. It's true.
  - What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
  - Yes. That's kind of how it was.
  - Uh-huh.
- - My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't
    drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet
    they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
  - Uh, I think they have.
  - Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally
    pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
- - Are you all right?
  - Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night
    -- all in yellow?!
  - All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
  - Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted
    life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
  - I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay
    is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
  - Yes.
  - I've got to go, now.
  - Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
  - That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
  - No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
  - How do I leave here?
  - The front door is open.  Will you be back?
  - I promise.
- - I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
  - Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
- - Is that a birthday cake?!
  - Yes, it is.
  - Gee-ma-nee!
- - Is this because of the radiation?
  - What?
  - Nothing.
- - Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
  - Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
  - A card?
  - Yes, sir.
  - Of course!
- - Bon soir, mademoiselle!
  - Are you French?
  - No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
  - Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card
    right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
- - Get out of here!
  - No, you get out of here.
- - Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
  - Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
- - Where are we going?
  - We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to
    the barber college.
  - No, I'm lost.
  - You're lost?
  - Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
  - Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
  - Dickhead?
  - A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
- - What's wrong with you?
  - I just had a mental picture of...
  - Here, pick these up!
- - I came on a bus.
  - Why doesn't that surprise me?
  - I don't know. Why doesn't it?
- - Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
  - Oh, that's nice.
  - Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying
    somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be
    an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
- - So far?
  - Yes, I'm right?
  - Right.
  - I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here
    in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct
    again?
  - Again.
  - Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
  - Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
  - See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't
    it?!
  - It was amazing.
  - Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
  - Do you own a car?
  - 'I''m not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers
    in the car.'
  - If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
  - You don't?
  - Nope.
  - Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
- - I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
  - Get away from me!!
- - Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby,
    if you'll take me to the hotel!
  - Rogers Hornsby?!?
  - He's all yours. I was holding him back.
- - Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
  - So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was
    holding these out, too.
- - So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
  - Yes.
  - And that's it?
  - Yes.
  - I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
  - Heck, no!  What?!
  - Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
- - So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
  - It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
  - Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
- - Wait!  Wait!
  - What is it?!
  - It's Perry!
  - Perry?
  - Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
  - Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
- - How's that?
  - Oh, I could die...
  - Over this?
  - Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
  - You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
- - Hey, what are you doing?!
  - I know a short-cut.
- - Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
  - I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
- - That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
  - Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
  - Right.
- - I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
  - Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I
    can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but
    it's very valuable. Now take it.
  - I can't, it's yours.
  - Take it. damn it!
  - Okay.
- - Why are you doing that?
  - I haven't brushed yet.
  - Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
- - Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
  - Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
- - I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
  - Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
  - Okay!  Damn!
- - Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
  - No.
  - Thank-Q!
  - Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what?
    A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or
    the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
  - I think it's the eyes.
  - The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you
    even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
  - Watching television in color.
  - Hey, no kidding?  In color?
  - Cross my heart and hope to die.
- - See, ya.
  - Why doesn't it never work out?
  - What?
  - Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
  - Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
- - '...Okay.'
  - It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why!
    So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I
    am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another
    low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy
    his marriage is.
  - Why not go to work for me?
  - Doing what?
  - Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to
    fill several large trucks.
  - Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
- - Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
  - How long would you need me?
  - Two weeks.
  - What's the pay?
  - What's fair?
  - I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
- - You got it! Wait here while I change.
  - Sure.
- - Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
  - They like Dr. Pepper.
  - Who are these people?
  - My Mom and Dad.
  - Very funny, smart ass.
  - Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
- - Wait! Wait!
  - What?
- - Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
  - Sorry.
- - Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
  - Hey, you know. I was thinking...
  - Night!
- - We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
  - It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
  - I guess we'll need another locker.
  - No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
  - You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
- - Thank you.
  - And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
  - Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but
    believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
  - Okay.
  - Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
- - There's something else I would like you to help me with.
  - Name it.
  - Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
  - Oh, I'm sure it will!
  - Then forget it.
  - No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
  - This is for me.
  - Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
- - Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
  - A wife?
  - Yes.
  - What for?
  - Because I want to get married.
  - Why?!
  - I don't want to be alone.
  - You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
  - Bites what?
  - The big one!
  - It does?
  - Sure.
  - I didn't know that.
  - Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
  - They're all divorced?
  - Everybody's divorced.
  - It didn't used to be that way.
  - I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
  - One who's not a mutant.
  - No dogs, huh? Okay.
  - And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
- - When do you need her by?
  - Two weeks.
  - Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife
    from Pasadena...that could take some time.
  - That's what I was afraid of.
- - Could we talk about that a little later?
  - Of course.
  - Thank you.
- - Get out!
  - The engine is still running.
- - Now, get out!!
  - Yes, ma'am!
  - Stop that ma'am crap!
  - Sorry!
- - You almost got us killed!
  - I told you I've never driven before!
  - Never drive again!
  - You said it would be easy!
  - I was wrong!!
  - Is this your house?
  - Yes!
  - I like it.
- - Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
  - He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll
    admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to
    know, isn't it?
  - Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
  - What?!
- - Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
  - Thank-Q!
  - I thought only hookers drank those things.
  - Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
- - Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
  - Um-hum.
  - I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
  - Yes!
  - You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and...
    you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
  - Wow.
- - Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
  - Good for you.
- - Where's he gone?
  - He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
  - He has a computer?
  - Sure.
  - In the house?
  - No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
  - May I please be excused?
  - Uh...yeah.
- - All right.
  - So, what are you seeing?
- - The what?
  - Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
- - The guy with the underpants!
  - That's boring!
- - About clothing?
  - Yeah.
  - Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
- - What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
  - It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the
    chair!
- - He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
  - Okay!
- - Hey, Eve!
  - Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of
    the rain?"
  - Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle.
    Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
  - Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
  - I certainly do!
  - Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous,
    don't you think?
  - No it's not!
  - Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
  - Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single
    card I've got left!
  - Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let
    me tell you something--
  - Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
  - Well...yeah. Okay.
- - My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
  - Look unimpressed.
- - No!  Not crazy!
  - Do I look crazy?
  - Yes!
- - Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
  - Good-bye!
- - I thought I was here to meet women.
  - Not that one!
  - I like her.
  - And don't be so obvious!
- - What have you ordered?
  - It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
- - What about her?
  - No way.
  - Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
  - Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means,
    don't you?
  - Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would
    call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
  - Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk,
    the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
  - How 'bout this one?
- - Okay. I like that.
  - Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
  - What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
- - Really?
  - Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with
    guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have
    me" signals!
- - That's ridiculous.
  - Maybe. But that's how it works.
- - Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
  - Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
  - Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
- - What?
  - Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
  - Did you?
- - You wanted to see me!
  - You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are
    no starving people, are there?!
  - Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
  - Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
  - I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to
    believe, but I've never lied.
  - You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
  - No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did.
    I think that you are the most--
  - I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
  - All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
- - Adam?!
  - I'm sorry.
- - I don't blame you!
  - Eve, I'm sorry.
- - I'm leaving, too.
  - But, Eve, I would--
  - And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous!
    You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
- - Eve?!
  - Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
  - I'm really sorry!
  - What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente
    Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
  - I know...and I'm really sorry.
  - Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
  - What?
  - Goodnight!
- - Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
  - Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
  - I know first aid!
  - Well, you had better!!
- - There.
  - Thanks.
- - I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
  - Is that what you call it?
  - But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found
    a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's
    a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
  - Sing it to me.
  - '"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I''m--on the street-- where
    you live."  It''s about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front
    of the house of the person he loves.'
- - Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
  - No.
- - Uh-huh. Adam?
  - Yes, Eve?
  - I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
  - Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
- - That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting
    outside for the taxi?
  - Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
  - My pleasure.
  - It was at least as good as the sky.
  - Really?  Okay!
  - And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
  - Neat. Goodnight!
- - Hi, Eve!
  - Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
- - Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for
    you. I promise.
  - '...All right, Eve.  If you say so.'
  - '...I do.'
  - Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I
    promise not to bother any of you ever again.
- - No.
  - See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well,
    frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
  - We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
  - My mother's like that.
- - How do you do?
  - I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
- - But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
  - Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
  - How 'bout a drink at the bar?
- - Please excuse this interruption.
  - Oh, brother...
- - Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff
    just a butt with hair?
  - What?!
  - I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
  - Shallow? I'm shallow?!
- - Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
  - Do ya?
- - Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
  - It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
  - Eve? I'm leaving.
- - I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
  - How do you do?
  - Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells
    me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
  - Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
  - Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
- - We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
  - Come where?
  - My office.
  - For how long?
  - Well, that depends...
  - I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I
    could see you tomorrow.
- - Let's go talk first, Adam.
  - Yes, ma'am.
- - The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be
    sure to pay my bill!
  - Young man, stop right there!
- - Hi!
  - Yes?
  - I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional
    Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
- - Oh, now, that's a great one!
  - You like it?
  - Bravo!
  - Thank-Q!
- - This is my new friend...
  - I'm Adam Webber.
  - He's really funny!
- - We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
  - Really?
- - You're kidding!
  - No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
  - Your mom was a dancer?
  - She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
  - Sure.
- - How come you were in my truck?
  - I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
- - What's your name?
  - Pris.
  - Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
  - Hi.
- - You want to go home?
  - I don't have one.
  - Oh.
- - Where are your folks?
  - They left.
  - What about friends?
  - I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
- - We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
  - We sure did.
- - I'm hungry, J.F.
  - I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
  - I was hoping you'd say that.
- - Whatcha doin'?
  - You scared me.
- - You look... better.
  - Just better.
  - Beautiful.
  - Thanks.
- - And you live in this building all by yourself?
  - Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
- - Twenty.
  - What's your problem?
- - Methuselah Syndrome.
  - What's that?
  - My glands.  They grow old too fast.
  - Is that why you're still here?
  - Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
- - Ah, you get hold of your friends?
  - As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna
    come tomorrow.
  - Good.
- - Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
  - I keep a lot of provisions right here.
- - What makes you think so?
  - You're all so perfect.
- - I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
  - Don't move.
  - Sorry.
- - Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
  - Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as
    you can.
- - You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down
    and see a...
  - What one?
- - What?
  - What desert?
  - Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
  - But how come I'd be there?
  - Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look
    down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
  - A tortoise.  What's that?
  - Know what a turtle is?
  - Of course.
  - Same thing.
  - I never seen a turtle.
- - But I understand what you mean.
  - You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
- - Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
  - I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
- - Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
  - Sorry.
- - We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
  - How do you know I'm not?
  - You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting
    a reading.
  - I'm tired of this.
  - Almost through.
- - Thanks.
  - Black?
  - Please.
- - Is this to be an empathy test?
  - Yes.
  - Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil,
    plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
- - May I ask a personal question?
  - Go ahead.
  - Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
  - No.
  - But in your profession that is a risk.
  - Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
  - Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale
    is a machine, isn't it?
  - One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
  - Sitting next to you.
- - Well?
  - If she is, the machine works.
  - The machine works.  She is.
- - How many questions did it take?
  - Thirteen.
- - She didn't know?
  - Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I
    think she was beginning to suspect.
- - How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
  - Five, maybe six.
- - And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
  - Discreetly.
  - All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper
    231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
- - Where the hell you been?
  - You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
  - Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
  - What's up?
  - Holden got hit.
- - Bad?
  - Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
  - I'll see you in a minute.
- - It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
  - A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If
    it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
  - But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule
    number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
- - It's artificial?
  - Of course not.
- - Are you apprehensive?
  - Why should I be?
  - For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more
    than your share.
- - I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
  - You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing
    jar.
- - I'd take him to the doctor.
  - You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
  - I'd kill it.
- - In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
  - Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
  - You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The
    girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
- - You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide
    to get an abortion.
  - I'd never get an abortion.
  - Why not?
  - That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
  - In your opinion.
  - It would be my child.
  - Sounds like you speaks from experience.
- - Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress,
    the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
  - Ugh.
- - Is there anything else?
  - I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
  - I've already got more help than I need.
  - I think you need more help than you've got.
- - There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he
    does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
  - Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
  - Two of us might be more effective than one.
  - I work alone.
- - You use your equipment, don't you?
  - So?
  - So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
- - Do I make you nervous?
  - Yeah.
  - I'm sorry.
- - I can imagine.
  - Can you?  I couldn't.
- - They probably want to find out when they were made.
  - Right.
- - Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
  - What do you want me to do?
  - Sit.
- - You ever take a bath with a man before?
  - There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
- - I told you I'd come back.
  - You did?
  - You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
- - Who is this?
  - Me and my dad.
  - Where is he?
  - Dead.
  - Oh.
- - How come you're not on the job?
  - I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
  - How are you doing?
  - Not too good.
- - What do people do in the afternoon?
  - If they are smart, they take naps.
- - Do you dream?
  - Yeah.  Sometimes.
  - I wish I could.
- - Did you cry when your father died?
  - Yeah.
  - That's another thing I can't do.
- - Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
  - It wasn't very good last night, was it?
  - I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something
    more to it.
  - What?
  - I don't know... I think I missed something.
  - Like?
  - I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
- - When was the last time you cleaned this place?
  - Hmmm?
  - Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
  - Don't be fooled by appearances.
  - It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
- - They could clean around the arrangement.
  - I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
- - But if I don't plug it in how can I...
  - Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
  - But then how can you...
  - I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
- - This feels stupid.
  - Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
- - You're sick, Deckard.
  - I never felt better.
- - Have you ever known anybody a long time?
  - You mean a woman?
  - Uh-huh.
  - What's a long time?
  - Ten years.
  - Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
- - Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
  - Because it's not.
  - Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
  - Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
  - Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
  - No, I don't.
- - Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
  - What difference will it make?
  - Just wait here.
- - You know what I think?
  - What?
  - That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
- - Yeah?
  - I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
- - There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
  - I don't know nothing about it.
  - You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
- - How do you mean 'exploited'?
  - Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory
    or otherwise repulsive to your person?
  - Are you for real?
  - Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the
    dressing room if I could.
  - What the fuck for?
  - For holes.
- - It that mother real?
  - Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real
    snake?
  - It's a good job.
  - You mean the snake.
- - The best.
  - Does it eat?
  - Come on.
- - Jeezus!
  - Sorry.
  - Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
- - You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
  - I bet I would.
  - Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
- - Me.
  - And who do I go to about you?
- - Taffey Lewis?
  - Yes?
  - Can I come in?
- - I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
  - Of course.
- - You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight
    is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
  - Do you recognize any of them?
- - This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks
    a little like this one but...
  - What did she want?
  - Who?
  - The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
  - Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
  - What night?
  - I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my
    partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
  - What's suck night?
  - That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks.
    Bit I don't think that's her.
  - You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
- - Book the good ones for where?
  - Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
  - What shows?
  - Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book
    two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high
    zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
- - Nerves of steel.
  - No rust?
  - I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
  - Meaning?
  - Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
- - During the road test...
  - Yeah?
  - Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
  - Huh huh.
  - Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
  - True.
- - But you haven't put in for emigration.
  - Nope.
  - You're going to be over the limit.
  - Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but
    I still rather be here than up there.
  - What if you change your mind?
  - They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
  - You sure?
  - Never been more sure of anything in my life.
- - Why didn't you go?
  - Too old.
  - But if you could?
- - My job is here.
  - Me too.
- - I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you
    like my new suit?
  - Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
- - Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
  - Sorry.
  - Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
  - I'm doing okay.
  - From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god
    damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
  - Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
  - Money?
  - No.  I got a problem.
  - Let's hear it.
  - I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
- - What's that?
  - I'm taking a piss.
- - Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care
    what you call it, an android can't have it.
  - These aren't just...
  - I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as
    the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
- - I think I have no money.
  - It's okay.  Forget it.
  - But I would like to buy you drink.
  - I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
  - Vodka!
  - Shot of vodka, please.
  - Thank you very much.
  - My pleasure.
- - Prosit.
  - Prosit.
- - You want to see my friends?
  - Sorry, don't have the time.
  - No problem.
- - Those cockroaches?
  - Ya.
- - How long you had these guys?
  - Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
- - Prosit.
  - Prosit.
- - You like to kiss her goodbye.
  - No thanks.
- - I like you.
  - I like you too.
  - One more, eh?
  - I gotta piss.
- - How old am I?
  - I don't know.
- - My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
  - Four years.
- - Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask
    for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind
    a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody
    once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made
    Esper should have been shot.
  - This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
- - You equipped for random questions?
  - Why, yes, of course.
  - You start.
  - The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh
    culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought,
    para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
  - How do I stop one?
  - Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without
    debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining
    leg than the fastest man can run,
  - Okay, but...
  - I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A
    direct hit is a positive retirement.
- - Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate
    the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period
    of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional
    responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
  - I know all that.
  - What about a summary then.
  - I think we're through for the night.
- - Yes?
  - Do you have something against science?
  - Not if it works.
  - And what in your estimation works?
  - The umbrella.
- - Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
  - Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
  - Longevity is classified.  No.
- - Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
  - 'Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive,
    trained for day care position.'
  - Next.
  - 'Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed
    to provide pleasure for long term spacers.'
  - Number three.
  - 'Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly
    competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.'
- - It's gotta be right for my customer.
  - Your customer, eh?
- - Well, when do you get paid?
  - Soon as I finish the job.
  - When might that be?
  - Day after tomorrow.
  - Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
- - Six, huh?
  - Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed
    two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through
    an electro- field.
  - What was he after?
  - There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and
    morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility
    they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the
    new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
- - You got a machine on it yet?
  - We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that
    all five are in the city.
  - Where do we start?
- - The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's
    a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's
    up shit creek.
  - What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
  - Industrial refuse.
  - Garbage man?
- - Yeah.
  - Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded
    that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You
    better get on it.
  - I was just about to have my dinner.
  - If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof
    in five minutes.  Good luck.
- - She was gonna get away.
  - Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin'
    tracker!
- - I didn't like her.
  - You didn't like her!?
- - Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
  - Yeah.
- - Yeah.
  - This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
  - Yeah.
  - She's not with you?
  - Who.
- - Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
  - Got it.
  - Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The
    cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program
    is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
- - If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as
    high as it comes.  Got it?
  - Yeah.  I got it.
  - Go.
- - What's going on down there?
  - He's not ready yet.
  - When?
  - Tomorrow, he says.
- - This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
  - Hello, glad to meet you.
- - Then we're stupid and we'll die.
  - Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
- - I think, therefore I am.
  - Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
- - I want to do it.
  - Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
- - I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself
    in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
  - Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the
    first floor.
- - How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
  - If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
  - Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
  - Well, actually
- - Why are you staring at us?
  - You're just all so... so different.
- - What, Sebastian?
  - You're androids.
- - What generation are you?
  - Nexus - 6.
- - Show me something?
  - Like what?
  - Like...
- - We have a lot in common.
  - You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
  - Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we
    don't want to die quite yet.
  - Of course not.
  - You could help us.
  - I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my
    league.
  - If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
- - What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
  - Dr. Tyrell?
- - He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
  - Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
  - He could?
  - His company made us.
  - I'd be happy to mention it to him.
  - Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
  - No.
  - When do you deliver your project?
  - This afternoon.
- - You're our best and only friend.
  - Thank you.
- - Where are you going, Sebastian?
  - Just thought I'd...
  - No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
- - The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
  - Oh?
- - Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go
    home.
  - Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
- - I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
  - It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
  - And what can he do for you?
  - Can the maker repair what he makes?
  - Would you like to be modified?
  - Had in mind something a little more radical.
  - What's the problem?
  - Death.
  - I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
- - I want more life, fucker.
  - Come here.
- - The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of
    an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
    can't be revised once it's established.
  - Why?
  - Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion
    mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
    ship sinks.
  - What about E.M.S. recombination?
  - We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a
    potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before
    we left the table.
- - Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
  - Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication,
    so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus
    again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
  - But not to last.
  - Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm
    afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
- - Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
  - I am?
- - I've done some questionable things.
  - Also extraordinary things.
  - Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
- - Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
  - We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
- - We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
  - You certainly have a nice place here.
  - Well stocked.
- - He knows what he's doing.
  - If he won't cooperate?
  - Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and
    he'll cooperate.
- - I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
  - I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have
    helped us.
  - Pris?
- - Let's go while there is still time.
  - Where?
  - Anywhere.
- - What's the point?
  - Not to be trapped.
  - You underestimate the trap, Mary.
- - One man.  He must be good.
  - Then go get him.
  - That wouldn't be very sporting.
- - Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The
    best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
  - I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
  - -- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the
    printing plant.
- - I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were
    too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young
    man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take
    over this syndicate when I retired.
  - I want him.
  - He'll be dealt with.
- - Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
  - The families who control the casinos?
  - Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor'
    and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
- - Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect
    counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
  - The Feds would be onto you in a month.
  - Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what
    our profit margin would be?
- - Why tell me this?
  - The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it
    for me.
  - You trust me?
  - I'll pay you.
- - With these?
  - Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the
    police.
  - If I say no?
  - You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
  - I don't have to.
- - Good.
  - He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You
    don't stand a chance.
- - That wasn't our deal.
  - You want him dead too.
  - After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
- - You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part,
    officer.
  - Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms,
    carrying official documents.
- - I want a gun.
  - It is not allowed.
  - We're police officers.
  - You're foreigners.
  - Work with me.  I want your best detective.
- - Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
  - Do you know what this is?
- - Could you fill me in?
  - Why don't you ask your chief detective?
- - Because I want you to tell me.
  - The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
  - Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
- - What's this?
  - Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
  - While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
  - Look.
- - Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
  - Twenty-four hours, detective.
- - Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
  - For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
  - You had my help, detective.
  - If anything happens to her while I'm here --
  - -- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where
    to start?  We will find them.
  - I have to get to Sugai.
  - Goodbye, officer.
- - How big a package we talking about?
  - This by this...
  - Dope?
  - Not in that company.
  - The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were
    full of it.
- - One guy do all the damage?
  - Yeah.
  - Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
- - Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The
    Japanese embassy is very interested.
  - Why?
  - He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
  - What?
- - You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
  - What...?  What if I say no?
  - Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe
    country.
  - Why me?
  - They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
- - It's not your job.
  - He was my partner.
  - They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost
    the prisoner!
  - I planned on catching him, Captain.
  - How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
  - He killed a police officer.
  - Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
- - '... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They''ll be all over Abolofia''s place.  Stick
    tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.'
  - Right.
- - Keep the change.
  - I'm taking you back.
- - Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking
    in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
  - Save it, I already took the tour.
  - You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here
    a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
- - I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
  - Guess I'm on a roll.
  - She's such a long way home for you.
  - Time, I've got plenty of.
- - This is my stop.
  - I'm amused.
  - Don't be.
- - Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
  - Then take it from him.
- - Don't give him any more.
  - He gets as much as he wants.
- - Ich said you left.
  - There was a change in plans.
- - Dead gaiijin's are big news.
  - Gaiijin?
  - An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
  - I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
  - I don't give tours.
- - You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
  - You have a helluva way of asking for help.
  - You have a helluva way of answering.
- - Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the
    street signs.
  - Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
  - I don't think so.
- - She ever pull down her shades?
  - Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
- - Don't be an ass.
  - He's on duty.
  - I paid for that.
- - You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
  - Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
- - I need your help, Joyce.
  - Where's Ich?
  - Unavailable.
- - I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's
    a hood.
  - I need someone to translate for me.
  - My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
  - It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
  - And I'm supposed to care?
  - You could fake it.
- - You're wrong to sell Ich short.
  - He drinks.
  - He's got a reason.
- - Where's the wife?
  - You met her.
- - I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
  - What do you chant?
  - '''Nam oyo ranged kyo.''  You think it''s dumb of course.'
  - Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
  - I don't remember saying yes.
  - I don't remember you saying no.
- - They want your autograph.
  - Who am I supposed to be?
  - This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles
    Bronson...
  - Tell them I'm not.
- - We're in?
  - The cheese...
- - You'll get Ich killed.
  - No one's keeping him here.
  - Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
  - Why would you care?
- - I still think you're a bastard.
  - What if I chant?
  - Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
- - Can't make you change your mind?
  - Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
  - Might be different in New York.
  - Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
  - I'd like that.
- - Where do we start looking for this guy?
  - Where would you look for the mafia?
- - Where're you going, Ichiro?
  - The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
- - '"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.'
  - Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he
    starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
  - No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
  - That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
- - '... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!'
  - What's the problem here?
- - Nick!
  - Give us a break...
  - It's Ichiro.  Ich.
  - Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
- - You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
  - I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
  - Why the hell not?
  - I don't, that's all.
- - What happened?
  - They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
- - It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ...
    keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
  - Why weren't you at the platform?
  - I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
- - You must leave?
  - Yeah...
  - I'll get him for you, Nick.
- - I've continued working on the case!
  - I can see that.
- - How'd you get this?
  - I stole them.
- - Know her?
  - We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
  - A snitch?
- - What's he saying?
  - He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
- - Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
  - Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
- - You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
  - No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
  - Nick...
- - What'd I tell you?
  - There she is!
- - Did I say that?
  - You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
  - Are we getting married?
- - You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
  - Sure.
- - Nick...
  - If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
- - Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
  - Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
- - Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
  - Ichiro --
  - Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
  - Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
- - Yakuza.
  - Good.  Very good...
- - She disappeared... shit!
  - You were too far behind.
- - You can't come in.  They don't want --
  - Gaiijin.
  - I'll check it out.
- - If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
  - You can trust me.
- - I'm not drunk...
  - We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
  - Nick --
  - Shut-up.
- - '... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.'
  - I want to yank Kobo.
  - Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
- - Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
  - San is an honorable title.
- - Nick!
  - A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
- - Where does this Sugai live?
  - A resort city, Beppu.
  - I want to go talk to him.
  - What...?  Why?
  - Because he knows how to get to our man.
  - He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
  - I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
- - It's very small.
  - Big enough.
  - It's illegal, Nick.
  - It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
  - Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself
    in danger for you anymore.
- - What's in the box?
  - For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting
    his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
  - So I bring some cheese?
- - No...
  - Let's go.  Him first.
  - Nick, you can't do this.
  - It's done.  You don't have to come.
- - Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
  - No.
  - Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
- - Start it.
  - I can't...
- - Just one, compadre... Kampai.
  - Kampai.
- - You did great, Ichiro.
  - I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
- - I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
  - I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
  - How many men?
  - I couldn't tell.
  - Joyce?
  - I don't know.
  - We need the plate to negotiate with.
- - Someone attacked him.
  - Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
- - Thank you.  You have one?
  - A wife.  She left.
  - I'm sorry.
  - Me too.
- - What's that for?
  - Luck.
- - You know, Nick, we can't lose.
  - Why's that?
  - Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
- - You all right?
  - Yes...
  - Call for help.
- - Louder, pal, louder.
  - Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
- - Think we'll get him, Nick?
  - We can't lose.
  - How can you be so sure?
- - Short shift?
  - Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
- - It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
  - Connie...
  - All right, how's the new partner?
  - High spirits, desire, commitment.
  - You'll take care of that.
  - Give me a break, would you?
  - If you give me one.
- - Are you expecting anyone?
  - I wasn't expecting you.
- - Squid?
  - Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
- - Joyce can be nice.
  - What'd she say?
  - That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
- - You cool, Ich?
  - Cool?
  - You all right?  You okay?
- - What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
  - What does Charlie mean?
  - Hey, all right.
- - I think she got to you, pappy.
  - You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
  - Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
- - '... It''s not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I
    think you did great.'
  - Thanks.
- - Hey, hey, where you goin'?
  - Home.
- - Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
  - -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
- - He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
  - So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
- - What's this?
  - Let go...
- - Back-up.
  - Get rid of it.
  - Why?
  - It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to
    show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
  - I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
- - Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
  - Charlie...
- - '... I found the goombah... Cavello. He''s --'
  - -- I should tear your head off.
  - Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But
    I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus...
    He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
  - -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
- - What are they doing now?
  - Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
  - Who do you think the Jap is?
  - Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
  - I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
- - Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
  - What?
- - Frank Abolofia.
  - The Wolf?
- - Some party.
  - Maybe we should do something?
  - Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
- - What are you doing?
  - Saving your life.
- - '... Nick, you''re the one that''s always saying you never go anywhere.'
  - I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
  - What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit
    is sadder than Ethiopia.
  - Beats forty hours on a plane.
  - They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I
    got a plan.
- - I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some
    raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force
    on the local Geisha scene.
  - Not a prayer.
  - Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest
    thing to hit town since Godzilla.
- - What'd you say?
  - Where is the subway station, please.
- - Nick... You up?
  - No.
- - Nick, have I been a good partner?
  - Number five with a bullet.
- - I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal
    with me.
  - Go to sleep, Charlie.
  - You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
- - I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
  - I didn't know.
  - The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't
    know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's
    on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't
    leave you with a lot of friends either way.
- - Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
  - Hey, when in Rome --
  - In Rome, I'll bow.
- - Let's go.
  - Nick, we can't just --
  - I said let's go, Charlie.
- - '... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we''re getting Mr. Moto on our side.'
  - Let's grab some food.
  - First decent idea you've had.
- - This should be it...
  - You said that in the last two places.
- - This the right place?
  - I hope not.
- - Getting very weird.
  - I'd feel better if we had some heat.
  - Maybe we should bail?
- - It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
  - I don't think he'd feel it.
- - '... He''s a sorry old guy, but I like him.'
  - He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
- - Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
  - Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
  - Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that
    girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
- - You got any money?
  - Thought you had a man for that.
  - I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
  - What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no
    ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called
    me.
  - Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
  - What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications
    now.
  - Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
- - Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin'
    ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough
    pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough
    medicine. What, you sick?
  - Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
  - Alright. How much you need, ho?
  - The hell you call me?
  - Eh, if the bootie fits...
- - Didn't know you was workin' here now?
  - I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped
    today?
- - What happened to your face?
  - Got in a little accident.
  - Yeah.
- - Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning,
    if you want.
  - You need money again?
  - No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at
    each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your
    daughter. I'm the only family you got.
  - You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
  - Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some
    peace, you know?
  - I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
  - I just wanted some make-up.
  - All that shit's on aisle 5.
- - I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
  - The hell are you talkin' about?
  - Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you
    can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about
    any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody
    in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you
    had.
- - I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
  - All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to
    every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well,
    I ain't gonna take that.
  - But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it...
    Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how
    you knew...
  - Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of
    doin' what I should'a done.
- - This ain't gonna work.
  - Rae...
  - I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
  - Rae don't do this now...
  - It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
  - Rae!
- - Hey.
  - Hey.
  - You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
- - I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
  - You feelin' sick?
  - I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
  - Yeah, I know.
- - I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
  - Yeah?
  - Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
- - Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet
    but... anyway, I got sick.
  - Are you wasted?
  - No. I just got a messed up stomach.
  - Holy shit!
  - What?
  - Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
  - I'm a what?
  - All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm
    you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
- - I feel better. Do you?
  - Yeah, I do.
- - Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how
    you and he... you and everybody...
  - Ronnie. Please, baby...
  - Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
- - Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole
    in ya!
  - Ronnie...
- - Thank you.
  - I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
  - You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them.
    Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
  - So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin'
    on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think
    he's crazy for thinkin' that?
- - You a preacher?
  - That's right.
  - Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if
    you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus
    would let you go on to heaven.
  - You could put it that way.
  - But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
  - What's on your mind?
  - You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just
    gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what
    they want and then... switch.
  - I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think
    folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up
    in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they
    want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
- - It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to
    my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump
    on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing
    ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so
    much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him
    and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like
    I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
  - Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
- - You won't at the square this mornin'.
  - Get me ten bags of mulch.
  - Yes'sir.
- - Keep the change on that.
  - Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma
    say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
- - What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could
    keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
  - Why she got a chain on her?
  - That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin'
    ya daddy.
  - Please don't tell my daddy.
  - My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya
    buddies, ya heard me?
- - So...  That your first time?
  - Yes'sir.
  - You struck some gold, didn't ya?
- - I skipped lunch.
  - Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
- - You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make
    up her mind.
  - I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But
    this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
  - That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your
    tongue.
  - I didn't start this, R.L.
- - Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
  - You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
  - I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here
    for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
  - Don't know if God wanna see me.
  - He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
- - Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
  - He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
  - Why's his britches round his knees?
  - R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
- - You get a call from Rose?
  - This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me
    now.
  - Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
- - Goin' dove huntin'?
  - You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
  - You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
- - You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't
    gonna be moved on this.
  - Ain't gonna be moved?
  - Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
  - Or what?
  - I told you to TURN BACK!
- - Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
  - Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
  - A naked woman, chained in ya house?
  - I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung
    her home.
  - Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you
    know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
  - I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
  - You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
  - Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white
    woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than
    being black and nearby.
  - What's that chain around her for?
- - Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks
    been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling
    it.
  - THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
- - Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
  - You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
  - You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
  - One thing at a time, Laz.
- - Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
  - Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
  - This all looks wonderful.
- - Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
  - Ask the chef.
- - Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land
    in a heap of trouble.
  - I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
  - You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
  - Not like that.
  - Then what?
  - She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
- - The hell is this shit?
  - What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
  - The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for
    years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
- - There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
  - I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
- - Heard about this morning.
  - We ain't here to talk about that shit.
- - Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
  - I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
- - 'And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is
    love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?'
  - I do.
- - Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn
    shame.
  - Word wit'cha. In private.
- - You need some weed?
  - Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair,
    split down the middle like?
  - That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
  - Huh?
  - I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean
    Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with
    that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on
    your own.
  - This Rae... you get with her?
  - Shit. Who hasn't?
  - Why you say that?
  - She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes
    she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's
    a nigga to do?
  - She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
  - That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
  - Now, hold up.
  - See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and
    you got me to fuck wit.
  - You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she
    was.
  - Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been
    all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
  - What'chu sayin'?
  - She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
- - What'chu sayin'?
  - What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
- - She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
  - What'chu sayin'?
  - What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
- - First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal
    and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
  - Uh-huh.
  - He tapped that.
  - Naw!
  - Go ask him.
- - You ever seen a train run on a woman?
  - Nuh-uh.
  - Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She
    into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in
    ya lap. I ain't playin'.
- - How a girl get like that?
  - Like I told you.
- - It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her.
    Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come
    lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin'
    no bus.
  - Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm
    tryin' to say... thank you.
  - Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good
    at it. Naw what I mean?
- - Teh... Tehronne?
  - Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
- - Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
  - GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
- - Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
  - Come on, gal...
- - Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
  - How long... how long I been out?
  - You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
  - Two days?
  - After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine
    in ya.
- - Where's Ronnie?
  - Well I don't...
  - Wait. He left.
- - I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
  - Don't need none.
  - Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
  - Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
  - Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
  - Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
- - Let me say somethin' first...
  - Why you got me chained?
  - Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
  - The fuck you been doin' to me?
  - I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found
    you in the road...
  - Get this Goddamn thing off me!
- - Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna
    run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on
    me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all
    night.
  - Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
- - Gal, you ain't right yet.
  - I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
  - How you let men treat ya like they do?
  - What?
  - These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
  - Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
  - You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in
    the backs of trucks.
  - The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The
    hell you think you are?
  - I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
- - I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen.
    You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
  - What do you want?
  - We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows
    in it...
  - WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME
    GO!
  - God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
- - You some kind'a pervert?
  - No ma'am.
  - Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
  - In my house, you watch that lip...
  - Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you
    want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
  - You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold
    the devil got on ya.
- - LET ME GO!
  - You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna
    mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
- - Now you get up! And you get in my house!
  - Or what?
- - Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
  - Whose doin' is that?
- - Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
  - You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
- - No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
  - Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
  - I said... STOP!
  - I CAN'T!
- - You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
  - Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
  - If I break one you gonna shoot me?
- - My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts.
    That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know
    why it's best to rotate em like that?
  - Uh-uh.
- - Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer.
    So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate.
    Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
  - Itches.
  - Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The
    parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns...
    you know the story?
  - Uh-uh.
- - The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand
    the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
  - I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
  - Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it
    in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't
    gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools,
    ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins
    in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should
    degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
- - My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin'
    guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let
    me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU
    GOT IS BILE, GAL!
  - Let go of me...
  - GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
- - Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
  - Uh-uh.
  - Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in
    the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how
    to make?
  - I don't fuckin' cook.
  - Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
  - Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with
    some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
  - If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae.
    RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now,
    you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
  - I can handle that.
  - Well, get to it.
- - They sure liked them devilled eggs.
  - You drink whiskey?
- - You take it straight?
  - Sure.
- - Want another?
  - We drinkin' buddies now?
  - To freedom.
- - Still makin' jokes?
  - No joke.
- - If you want... I can take you back to town now.
  - I ain't in a hurry.
- - Could you do somethin' for me?
  - Anything.
- - My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
  - I'm here with you.
  - I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am
    I gonna put all this love?
- - Tell me what to do.
  - The... chain helps.
- - I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
  - You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
  - He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die,
    Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
- - Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
  - No one's gonna hurt you no more.
  - You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
- - Where you gonna be?
  - Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
  - I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
- - You took care of your wife, like you do me?
  - I tried.
- - What is it?
  - Nothin'.
- - Get'chu at that table up yonder.
  - By myself?
  - You can handle it.
- - Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
  - Yeah, gal I been here before.
  - I guess you have.
- - Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
  - Don't think that'd be wise.
  - I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
  - I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
- - Sorry.
  - Looks like you know a song.
  - Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
- - How you feelin' today?
  - You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can
    open a little bit more.
  - I know that.
  - Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn
    a song.
  - Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
  - No, you do it. I can't sing.
  - Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes.
    And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you
    love.
  - What I love.
  - Get a good picture in your mind.
- - Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You
    like it?
  - I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
  - Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
- - I don't want you to let go.
  - Maybe I won't.
- - YOU SHUT UP!
  - Careful how you point that gun, boy.
  - Or what? OR WHAT?
  - Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
  - Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
  - You sayin' you'll do what?
  - You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
  - BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
- - You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
  - Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not?
    If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy,
    and you squeeze that trigger back.
- - GODDAMMIT, RAE!
  - BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have
    is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town,
    givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
  - SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
  - Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all
    to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear
    ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man
    now. A real KILLER!
- - Don't... don't say that to me...
  - Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk.
    I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get
    out of my face!
- - Like a man.
  - Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the
    only man with her.
- - Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
  - Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
- - We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the
    water company...
  - If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin'
    pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
  - Think this about money still, ya old fool?
  - Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never.
    You hear?
  - How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
- - Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
  - Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people.
    Tell me, what's friendly about that?
  - I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot
    in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got
    living to do.
  - And you gonna live it with him?
- - Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage...
    it just got sick. That's all.
  - Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
  - I keep the heat on.
  - That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
  - Kept us warm for twelve years.
- - I deserve better than this.
  - Better'n me?
  - Better than what you give.
  - Rose... please...
  - Laz... You can't say nothin'...
  - If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
  - I don't love ya no more.
- - God forgive you, for how you done me...
  - Let go...
  - My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you
    did. Ya bled me.
  - Let go of my arm...
  - Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
  - LAZ, I said let...!
  - You better pray, gal. You better pray...
  - Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
- - Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
  - It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career.
    Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I
    said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
- - Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with
    them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
  - Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
  - Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
  - I begged him not to go. And he did.
- - You wanna go home?
  - It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
  - Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
- - Better?
  - Yeah.
- - It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
  - You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be
    halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's
    gonna be thinkin' about you?
  - You go to hell.
- - Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
  - Stop what?
- - Thought you had a skirt earlier.
  - I got others.
- - This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy.
    I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles
    dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
  - I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
  - I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What
    Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
- - The fuck you laughin' at?
  - You don't got half what Tehronne got.
- - Still need a lift?
  - Yeah. Transmission's shot.
- - Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
  - You gonna miss your bus.
- - Holy shit.
  - Yeah.
  - Sit down, man. Need a beer?
  - Sure.
  - Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
- - What happened?
  - They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before
    we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like
    my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the
    numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin'
    happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety.
    It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but...
    they sent me home.
  - I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
- - I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her
    anywhere.
  - She's around. Always is.
  - I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real
    down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell
    me if you knew somethin', right?
  - You been home yet?
  - Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
  - You need a ride?
- - This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned
    it.
  - She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
  - I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see
    how she could get scared...  ...and run.
- - Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get.
    You never had that shit back in school...
  - That's not right, really, cuz I...
  - You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay
    for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture
    and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
- - And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
  - Now wait...
  - With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to
    that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
  - I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked
    to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
- - YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
  - It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd
    just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She
    listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And
    since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
  - The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your
    first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to.
    You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was
    havin' some kind'a fit.
- - You gonna steal my truck?
  - Make yourself at home. You done it already.
- - And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
  - That young lady's size, right'cher.
  - Well, that makes it easier.
- - Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
  - These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
  - For your hands?
  - Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented
    creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called
    Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp.
    So... perhaps just after a shower.
  - I'll take a jar of that, too.
- - Hi.
  - Hey.
  - You ain't the kicker, are you?
  - No, ma'am.
  - Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking
    game, ya'll gonna lose.
  - Can I put it in your mouth?
  - Okay.
- - He black alright, he just ain't blue.
  - Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live
    shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
  - Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
  - You seen my snake-skin shoes?
- - Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from
    a black cow?
  - Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got
    this place shakin' back in the day.
  - Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips
    he got pickin' that guitar.
- - Lazarus?
  - Oh! Gave me a start.
  - I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
  - You hurt it?
  - I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this
    mornin'.
  - Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on
    Sundays.
  - Well. It's good to see you.
- - Angela?
  - Yes?
  - I need to uh...
  - Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
  - My little niece... she got this deep cough.
  - You take her to a doctor?
  - No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy
    left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what
    to do.
- - Is your niece older than 12?
  - Oh, she older than that.
- - My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription.
    You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give
    me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
  - This gonna get you in trouble?
  - Not if no one finds out.
- - Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't
    gonna be around no more... So if you...
  - I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago...
    how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
  - Don't make it less true.
- - I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter
    beans.
  - You didn't have to do this.
  - Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece,
    she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
  - Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
- - This was very sweet of you.
  - Well. Hope you enjoy it.
- - I bet you have loyal customers.
  - You liked what I brung ya?
  - Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic
    under the gazebo.
  - That'd be nice.
  - I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
- - I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
  - At church?
  - Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays
    and Wednesdays, so...
  - You gonna sing me somethin'?
  - When? Now? Oh. No.
  - Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
- - Hey.
  - Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your
    home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
  - What do you need?
  - I need ya help again.
- - More cough syrup?
  - Can I come in?
- - I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine
    you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
  - Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
  - Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't
    want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better
    ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
- - Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can
    get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got
    a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't
    want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
  - I do. God's truth. I do.
- - What are you doing?
  - Just wanted to see.
  - You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Then start taking them seriously.
  - Yes, ma'am.
- - Is the flight full?
  - I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
  - Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
- - You have excellent English.
  - Thanks.
  - How do you want to pay?
  - Cash.
- - Is that everything?
  - Yes.
  - Right. Okay. Good.
- - It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's
    close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm
    having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find
    the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
  - Yes.
  - I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's
    the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
  - Yes.
  - I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
  - Yes.
  - I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
- - So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
  - Yes.
  - I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
  - Yes.
- - And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
  - Yes.
- - Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
  - Yes.
  - Good. Or should I speak slower?
  - Yes.
  - Do you follow or should I speak slower?
  - Yes.
- - Uh... Are you a giraffe?
  - Yes.
- - Today is bath day.
  - Sorry?
- - I don't understand.
  - Happy bath day.
- - Syevodnya?
  - Syevodnya
  - Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
- - '"Frenzy".'
  - Yes I know.
- - They go. John. They go.
  - What's wrong?
  - They go.
  - Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
  - They go.
- - Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would
    have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of
    understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But,
    you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
  - You don't understand anything.
  - I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being
    dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean
    strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking
    Famously.
- - Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract
    me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
  - It's makes it easier. Okay.
  - I don't want to know.
  - It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty
    obvious why.
  - That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
- - So what are you going to do?
  - I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there
    will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
  - They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get
    your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
  - Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with
    me.
  - Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
  - Well as it turns out I did.
- - You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
  - No I don't.
  - In the world.
  - I know you just want to punish me --
  - I do. I want to very badly.
  - So you're just going to be vindictive
  - In every sense. If at all possible.
  - You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
  - Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
- - Where's the restroom?
  - What?
  - I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
  - What? No you're not..
  - I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
  - No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
- - You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
  - Have you got your passport?
  - What?
  - Shut up. Have you got your passport?
  - Yes.
- - Give me some money.
  - I don't have any money.
- - What?
  - I said I don't have any.
- - So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
  - I don't want to talk about him.
  - Fine.
  - It's none of your business.
  - Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
- - So uh...
  - Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
  - Oh Jesus.
  - If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
  - Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
  - But, you know, so what?
- - Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
  - He will come back.
  - Excuse me?
  - He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
  - Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
  - No. But you tend to tie them up.
- - I don't want to talk about it.
  - Why not?
  - Shut up. I'm not listening.
  - You don't want to talk about it.
  - No.
  - Okay we won't talk about it.
- - We'll pretend it never happened.
  - So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
  - I don't hate you.
  - Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't
    you? For money. To make money.
  - And? What are you saying?
  - And. It's wrong.
  - And who says what is wrong.
  - And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
  - What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
  - So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
  - Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty
    moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
  - Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
- - So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him,
    or what?
  - Sometimes.
  - Sometimes which?
  - Sometimes neither.
  - Some... What does that mean?
  - There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
  - I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
  - Why?
  - Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a
    woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
  - So now you hate all women?
  - I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
  - Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
- - What?
  - You...
  - I got what I paid for.
  - You didn't mind too much.
- - It wasn't what I wanted.
  - So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
  - You don't understand me.
  - You don't understand you either.
- - Excuse me?
  - Get out
  - You are throwing me out.
  - Get out.
- - You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
  - You don't have to say anything
  - What? I... I wasn't saying...
  - Please, there's no... Oh.
  - I wasn't saying anything.
  - Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
- - Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
  - Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
  - The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
  - Thank Christ for that.
  - You are pretty naive if you think it is.
  - I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got
    to show for it? Nothing.
  - I don't have nothing.
  - Well what have you got?
- - Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
  - No.
  - Have you had any before?
  - No.
  - Are you scared?
  - Not really. Maybe a little.
- - What happened between you and the blonde?
  - What?
  - The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
  - It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
  - Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you
    for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
  - She's dead.
- - I'm sorry.
  - I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
- - What?
  - I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
  - She's alive?
- - She's alive!! She is not dead?
  - Laugh it up.
- - You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
  - I'm trying to quit.
  - I've got news for you. It's not working.
  - I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
  - Nobody's that unhappy.
  - Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
  - I don't want anyone to die.
  - Except for Small Eyes.
  - Except for Small Eyes.
- - I don't know.
  - What was her name?
  - What's your name?
- - You know you can come under the blanket.
  - It's alright.
- - I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
  - No. I think I better just go.
  - Okay. Thank you.
  - Whatever.
- - Yeah. No thanks.
  - Please. Why not?
  - Because it was a lie.
- - Okay. Goodbye.
  - Goodbye.
- - Something else.
  - Okay. Promise?
- - You can probably buy them on the flight.
  - I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
  - Goodbye.
  - You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
  - Whatever.
  - I'm sorry.
  - Please.
- - It's not mine.
  - It's not mine either.
  - It's what you came back for.
- - Why?
  - I'm not asking you to marry me.
  - No. What? No. I know.
  - It's more like a date.
  - It's a long way to go for a date.
  - Tell me about it.
- - What does it mean?
  - Maybe you will find out.
- - Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
  - Right.
- - My name's Sophia.
  - Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
- - How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
  - Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
  - You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
  - What are you doing here?
- - Sorry. You've lost me...
  - I'm asking what you're here for.
  - What?
- - What did he say?
  - He says he feels safe here.
- - I need to know who you are first please.
  - Oh.  We are Russian.
  - Yes. I know.
  - Good.
  - And...
  - And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia
    can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not.
    But we say cousin. This is for you.
- - Hold on.
  - Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
- - So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
  - Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
  - Right.
  - We better watch him. He's crazy.
  - Right.
  - I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle
    along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't
    mean he smokes me.
- - No.
  - Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
- - So?
  - So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod
    I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
- - What was that?
  - I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
  - Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
- - So how long will you be in England?
  - Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
  - You must have a visa or something...
  - You're asking for my documents?
  - No, no...
- - She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
  - Uh. Do you like England?
  - Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
- - She says she has a secret to tell.
  - What?
- - When?
  - '"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."'
  - I...
  - '"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father
    had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don''t know the word. Like for watching
    uh... for watching the birds.'
- - Binoculars.
  - Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
- - What was that?
  - Oh nothing.
  - Tell me.
  - No. It is too judgmental.
  - Tell me what he said.
  - He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
- - You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
  - No. It's not that.
  - Do you believe in love?
  - I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
  - It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is
    the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches
    Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment.
    We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us.
    The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
- - How is bank?
  - Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
  - To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
- - I understand. I'm so sorry
  - You can stay tonight.
  - I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
  - Good night.
- - Put the fucking kettle down.
  - John.
  - Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to
    make him.
- - He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John,
    he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
  - What? What does he want?
- - What did he say? Tell me!
  - He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you
    must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
  - What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
  - He wants money.
  - Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
- - He wants a lot of money.
  - I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
  - He wants the money from your bank.
  - I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
  - You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
  - I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
- - Oh Jesus.
  - He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
  - Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
- - Just leave her alone.
  - I'm so sorry.
  - Leave her alone.
- - This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
  - Ch...
  - To customers approaching the bank from the rear
  - Right.
  - You can see why it's sensitive?
  - Uh... Yes.
- - Hello.
  - I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
  - Right.
- - Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
  - There's over eighty thousand here.
- - It's enough isn't it?
  - What do you mean?
  - You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
  - Do you want to stop?
  - Yes.
  - We'll stop then.
- - What's this?
  - It's nothing. I burnt myself.
  - That's not a burn.
  - It is. I did it cooking.
- - Do you like it?
  - Yeah.
- - Say thank you.
  - Thank you.
- - What?
  - You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
- - A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
  - Name it.
- - What? What are you doing?
  - What are you doing here?
- - What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
  - Leave him!
  - You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
  - No I haven't.
- - You first.
  - Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
- - Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
  - What for?
  - You know what for.
  - No I don't.
  - I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
  - I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
  - Such as?
- - When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who
    paid?
  - Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
  - I paid for those guitar cases.
- - Yeah it was okay.
  - Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
  - The sets were good.
  - The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans,
    sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was
    really clever.
- - How did you get here?
  - We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
  - Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
  - We rented a car.
  - You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
- - Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
  - He's up with your father.
- - How is he?
  - He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because
    he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
  - How much time does he have left?
  - You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
- - I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent
    Newsweek.
  - Really! That's wonderful.
- - Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
  - Of course.
  - What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
  - Yes.
  - How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's
    another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
  - Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
- - Would you say you understand Josephine?
  - Yes. But that's a different...
  - No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married
    -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental
    level. Just the same as you two.
- - Josephine and I have a lot in common.
  - Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only
    see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer
    than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
  - True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all.
    Or ever will.
- - I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you
    didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers
    out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents
    and children can stand each other at all.
  - But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
  - Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right
    now.
- - Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through.
    I wouldn't know what's important.
  - Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
- - Was she one of your teachers?
  - No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
  - Do you know who that is?
- - That really happened?
  - Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
- - Is he awake?
  - He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
- - Mom?
  - Yes?
- - Did you and Dad have any other property?
  - I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right
    away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
  - So you never bought any land.
  - Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
- - I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes
    up, one of us should be there.
  - I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
  - That's okay?
- - Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
  - Yes. Thank you.
- - It's bad.
  - It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
  - You need to go.
  - Probably tonight.
- - I'm going with you.
  - You don't have to.
  - I'm going with you.
- - I talked with your father last night.
  - Did you?
- - You never told me how your parents met.
  - They met at Auburn.
  - What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never
    told me any of that.
  - That's because most of it never happened.
  - But it's romantic.
- - Mmm.
  - Mmm, what?
  - Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
- - Do you love your father?
  - Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
  - Do you love him?
- - You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here.
    And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another
    house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family.
    Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second
    life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand
    this boring place.
  - But it's not true.
  - What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
- - Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to
    tell me I'm not crazy.
  - You're not.
  - I need you on my side.
  - I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
- - What happened?
  - Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
  - Is he going to be okay?
- - Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
  - Yes.
  - Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
- - I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
  - We'll have to pick up a copy.
- - I'm going to get started on dishes.
  - I'll help you.
- - I'm going to check on him.
  - I need to lie down for a bit.
- - I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
  - I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
- - Do you like it, being pregnant?
  - I do.
  - I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was
    travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him
    with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and
    kicking.
- - Oh. Oh.
  - Hello.
  - I wasn't expecting you.
- - Are you Jenny Hill?
  - I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost
    said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
- - How did you know my father?
  - This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in
    town knew him.
- - Were you and my father having an affair?
  - Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half
    hour.
  - I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed
    he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
- - Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed,
    why didn't you just ask Eddie?
  - Because he's dying.
- - Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image
    of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this
    late in the game.
  - My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot
    of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
- - Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
  - 'No, it''s logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there''s only two
    women: your mother and everyone else.'
  - You didn't become crazy.
  - Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never
    love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
- - Wait! I need those!
  - There is no softer ground than town.
- - I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
  - Really.
  - There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
- - This is why you don't show work in progress.
  - Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
  - I can't imagine any place better than here.
  - You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
- - It's me. Norther Winslow.
  - I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way
    out in Texas.
- - I don't believe it!
  - I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole
    life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa,
    half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
  - That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
- - So what are you up to now?
  - I'm robbing this place.
- - This is it? The whole vault.
  - '''Fraid so.'
  - Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
- - I'm sorry.
  - Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to
    find today...
- - Oh.
  - But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton.
    See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years
    older than you.
- - Daffodils?
  - They're your favorite flower.
  - How did you get so many?
  - I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could
    get my wife to marry me.
- - You don't even know me.
  - I have the rest of my life to find out.
- - How can I convince you to stop?
  - Go out with me.
- - I was drying out.
  - I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a
    fern.
- - You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife,
    soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
  - Make him stop.
- - What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
  - I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which
    never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the
    day I was born.
  - Jesus Christ.
  - Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
  - Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
  - No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand
    times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For
    one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around
    Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
- - The one about the witch.
  - Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
  - I'm not scared.
- - You --  -- are in for a surprise.
  - Am I?
  - Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and
    the midnight feedings...
  - Did you do any of that?
  - No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead
    this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
  - You think I'm up for it?
  - You learned from the best.
- - People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
  - Really.
  - Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
  - The Old Lady by the swamp.
  - She was a witch.
  - No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
  - I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
  - So how does it happen?
  - Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
- - There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of
    this coffee shop near the office.
  - Okay.
  - And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for
    a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
  - What did he say?
  - You owe me three-fifty.
  - Really.
  - True story.
- - When did you ever work in an office?
  - There's a lot you don't know about me.
  - You're right.
- - Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
  - You mean, while I'm here.
  - I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
- - Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
  - I will.
  - You know where the chemicals are?
  - I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
- - I thought you weren't dying.
  - I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
- - Why not religion, Dad?
  - It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
- - Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
  - Oh, so you know.
- - Did I ever tell you about how...
  - Yes.
- - The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
  - I think someone hasn't.
- - But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
  - Dad?
  - Son?
  - Can we talk?
- - Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
  - Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water,
    only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A
    mammoth.
  - Dad!
  - What?
  - I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
  - Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer
    questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
  - The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent
    is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad.
    I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
  - What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
  - I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
  - I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
  - You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year
    old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is
    ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed
    your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that
    everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to
    have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just
    as charming and just as fake.
  - You think I'm fake.
  - Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
- - Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through
    his whole life never understanding me.
  - It would kill you, huh?
- - What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
  - Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
  - I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see
    that, it's your failing, not mine.
- - The river.
  - The river?
- - Tell me how it happens.
  - How what happens?
  - How I go.
- - I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
  - Like this.
  - Okay. Okay.
- - Let's get out of here.
  - Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
- - Where are we headed?
  - You say...
  - The River!
- - It's unbelievable.
  - Story of my life.
- - You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
  - Yes. Exactly.
- - Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've
    got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
  - Really?
  - Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot,
    can't you?
  - I can.
  - So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should
    be in the big city.
- - You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
  - What's your name, Giant?
  - Karl.
  - Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave
    with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for
    a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
  - You don't like it?
  - I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's
    life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say?
    Join me?
- - Okay.
  - Okay.
- - What did she say?
  - Beats me.
- - You know anyone's who's taken it?
  - That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked
    it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other
    way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
- - You're not trying to run away?
  - Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
- - Really.
  - 'You''re lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk
    through the jungle, you''d hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those
    parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.'
- - Hi. How are you feeling?
  - I was dreaming.
  - What were you dreaming about?
- - Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night,
    I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I
    was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back
    to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
  - That's terrible.
  - Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't
    three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa
    is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps
    is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning
    my Grampa was dead.
- - Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
  - No, I understand.
  - He was slipping her a little extra cream.
- - He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
  - Stop.
  - They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
- - Spooning the sherbet.
  - Can I take your picture?
  - You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
  - Please?
- - That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed
    to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
  - I never knew.
  - Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong
    anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
  - Oh, so this is a tall tale?
  - Well, it's not a short one.
- - I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
  - Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
- - Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
  - Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
- - There was one time when I was eleven...
  - You were talking about your wedding.
  - I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell
    a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting
    either.
  - I like your stories.
  - And I like you.
- - Did you see that woman?
  - What did she look like?
  - Well, she... uh...
  - Was she nekkid?
- - Yeah.
  - It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
- - How old are you?
  - Eighteen.
  - I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll
    only be 38.
  - You're pretty good at arithmetic.
  - And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
- - How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
  - I suspect it will hurt a lot.
- - Promise me you'll come back.
  - I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
- - You must be Edward Bloom.
  - How did you know?
- - No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business
    with me except for you. You're buying the town.
  - Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.
    You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
  - So I've heard.
  - I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing
    will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
- - In so many words, yes.
  - Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon
    it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
  - It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've
    been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
- - Helping people makes me happy.
  - I'm not convinced you should be happy.
  - I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- - You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
  - I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
- - I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
  - I see. I thank you for your time.
- - It's okay, just leave it.
  - I can get it. I can just...
- - Lord, I'm sorry I...
  - Please. Go. Just go.
  - I'll...
  - Go.
- - Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in
    love with my wife.
  - I know.
  - And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
  - Lucky girl.
  - I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
- - Will.
  - Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
  - A pleasure.
- - Can I see him?
  - Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
- - Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest
    annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
  - My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
- - How long have you known my father?
  - Thirty years. Maybe more.
  - How would you describe him?
  - Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
- - Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
  - A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
  - Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
  - No.
  - Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account
    of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there
    were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to
    miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries
    then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And
    that's the real story of how you were born.
- - Or are you too scared?
  - I'll go in right now and get that eye.
  - Then do it.
  - Fine, I will.
  - Fine, you do it.
  - Fine, I'm doing it.
- - You get the eye?
  - I brought it.
  - Let's see it.
- - Bloom!
  - Don.
  - What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
  - I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
- - Welcome to ya. What's your name?
  - Edward Bloom.
- - Bloom like a flower?
  - Yes.
  - Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
- - You were expecting me?
  - Not yet.
- - What is this place?
  - The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton,
    right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
  - The poet? What ever happened to him?
  - He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll
    have him tell you.
  - No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
- - Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
  - It truly is.
- - I have to leave. Tonight.
  - Why?
  - This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd
    consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
  - No one's ever left.
- - You won't find a better place!
  - I don't expect to.
- - Great, great. That's fantastic.
  - It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
- - Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
  - That's great.
- - See! The big guy likes it.
  - I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
  - Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
  - I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
  - Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
  - Yes!
  - I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
  - Who is she? Where does she live?
  - Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
- - What do you mean? You don't even know me.
  - Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you
    got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything
    but the clothes on your back.
  - I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
- - Someone stole my backpack.
  - Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning.
    Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
- - I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have
    much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
  - Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
  - I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me
    who she is.
- - Didn't kill anything, did I?
  - A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
  - That would explain the indigestion.
- - I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a
    lot of. You could get any girl.
  - There's only one I want.
- - Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over,
    so you better hurry.
  - Thank you.
  - Good luck, kid.
- - You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen
    to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister
    and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her
    pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
  - Sir, yes, sir!
  - Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse
    to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes,
    sir!
  - Sir, yes, sir!
  - In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose
    entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of
    this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents
    a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross
    me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
  - Sir, yes, sir!
  - So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler
    military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
- - Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not
    wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their
    duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said
    conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions
    are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
  - Sir, yes, sir!
  - LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work
    your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find!
    Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin
    wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and
    Childs!
- - This is totally unnecessary --
  - He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
  - But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
  - He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the
    territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and
    haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
  - He's not Army, it's not official --
  - Then it's unofficial.
- - Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup.
    If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
  - I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on
    a transport leaving here at 1700 --
- - You think he did it?
  - No --
- - What do you think?
  - It's too neat.
- - You want Kendall, don't you?
  - He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
- - You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong...
    it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
  - We know.
  - I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
- - What happens to Dunbar now?
  - Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand
    if I don't walk you out.
- - You never told me why you got kicked out of...
  - The army kicked you out for drugs...
- - Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo
    from last night?
  - Yeah.
  - Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard
    he got out okay.
- - Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
  - No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
  - You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
- - So?
  - Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
- - Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
  - Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
- - What the fuck happened to you --
  - What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're
    gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
- - Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
  - Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest
    face in the crowd --
- - Thank God...
  - What the fuck are you doing?
- - This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
  - Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
- - We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been
    working in here, but --
  - Where's your shirt, Mueller?
  - I used it to start the fire --
  - Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer
    -- you said you burned yours?
- - Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
  - We're not going anywhere.
- - Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder
    of Sergeant Nathan West --
  - The fuck are you talking about --
  - You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
  - Bullshit --
  - Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in
    Sergeant West's body --
  - Shut up!
- - Tell him to shut up --
  - -- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of
    itself --
- - We just want --
  - What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees.
    Things are not what they seem.
- - He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
  - He wanted more than that.
- - He said what?
  - '"You''re gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.'
  - No one else heard it?
  - He whispered it in my ear.
- - Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
  - Because he'd shot Mueller.
  - But you didn't see it, right?
  - Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead,
    Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
- - Pike never confessed.
  - We've been making progress, I see.
- - Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses
    fly the coop?
  - Fifty minutes.
  - Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood
    money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not
    think about it?
- - Pike never confessed.
  - No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell
    you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants
    who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
- - Dunbar says you were.
  - Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of
    this line of questioning --
- - You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies,
    designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing
    time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can
    protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory
    to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
  - You can't threaten me --
- - It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm
    going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
  - What?
- - It won't work --
  - It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet
    in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights.
    So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with
    it, because you're pissing me off!
- - Enjoy your flight to Washington --
  - Wait --
  - What.
- - Dunbar's telling the truth.
  - Wrong answer --
  - We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because
    I threatened him.
- - Who, Levi --
  - Childs.
- - I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or
    I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX
    scam, my father would be finished.
  - I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time.
    We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that
    kind of secret --
  - So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
- - What happened with Nunez?
  - He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
- - Maybe we shouldn't go.
  - The faggot speaks.
  - You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
  - You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
- - We should tell him we're not going.
  - Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't
    want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
- - They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
  - Poor fucker my ass...
  - You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
- - Pike and I got separated --
  - Yeah and he doesn't know when --
  - I remember now, it was before the explosion --
  - Oh, you remember now --
  - I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
- - I was freezing from the hurricane --
  - So you took off your shirt?
  - To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and
    changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead,
    cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they
    work --
- - The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're
    both fucked --
  - What are you talking about?
  - A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The
    press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your
    fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
- - How?
  - Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm
    tied up, but we get the others to go along --
  - I don't think I want to hear this --
  - Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's
    got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the
    guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek
    and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell
    the story right.
- - Pike, please --
  - Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
- - Hostile and uncooperative.
  - Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
- - Ah, Christ
  - You knew Sergeant West?
  - He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
- - I didn't mean that as a compliment.
  - Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern
    Army.
  - And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
- - Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
  - You and the Colonel go back.
  - He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
  - You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans
    PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
  - It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
  - Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having
    you involved in this.
  - Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
- - Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe
    in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip
    over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to
    take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
  - Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets
    Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
  - Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
  - Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
  - Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
  - Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his
    name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is
    Dunbar.
  - He's in interrogation?
  - Yes.
  - Move him.
  - Why?
  - Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which
    doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
  - Excuse me?
  - Is Dunbar cute?
  - That is the most unprofessional --
  - Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes
    or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does
    he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal
    a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and
    a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
- - Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him
    with everything you got.
  - Good cop/bad cop?
  - Something like that.
- - I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a
    badge, he won't talk to you.
  - Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
- - The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
  - See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for
    you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
- - Baseball?
  - I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
  - You made me look like an idiot --
  - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look
    good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
- - You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
  - You're right. We should sit in silence.
  - We're in the middle of a murder case --
  - Best time for banal chit-chat.
- - What is that?
  - Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why
    you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
- - Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any
    real doubt of joining up.
  - You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
  - Something like that. You?
  - I lost a bet.
- - You're kidding.
  - Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is...
    I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world,
    crap like that. Didn't really work out.
- - This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
  - The very same.
  - You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to
    you, right?
  - I plan to grow on you.
  - You're off to a late start.
  - So noted.
- - You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
  - Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
  - He's telling the truth, up to a point.
  - What point?
- - Something wrong?
  - Being back here. Gives me the willies.
  - Not the happiest of memories?
- - Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
  - Got it.
- - That was kid gloves?
  - Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
- - But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
  - I lied. Wait for it...
- - '"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?'
  - I don't think that has anything to do with --
  - That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught
    me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil
    puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing
    a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's
    always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
- - I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
  - Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
- - Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths
    except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies --
    he didn't see any crime committed.
  - Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder
    to witness it for you --
- - Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
  - I don't know.
- - Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
  - You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of
    time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's
    your confession.
- - Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
  - Watch me.
  - You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
- - West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was
    Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making
    him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen
    years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed
    him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
  - You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator
    you're phenomenal --
  - Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
- - I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I
    guess I was wrong --
  - Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance",
    Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is
    going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
  - But you will.
- - Why do you care?
  - Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty
    thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
- - I didn't shoot West...
  - What?
  - Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was
    blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
- - At least you and Kendall agree on that.
  - What happened next?
- - 'Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they''re going out on the regular
    Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin
    it on Pike.'
  - And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going
    to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have
    a witness.
  - Dunbar.
  - Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only
    let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time
    comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
  - They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
  - And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
  - So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall
    guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
  - Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
  - Buttfucks the cabin?
  - And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz,
    bang, zoom, happy ending.
  - So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's
    son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
  - That bugs you too?
  - Little bit.
  - Let's go talk to Bill...
- - We're fucked, I know --
  - They got their stories straight.
  - What?
  - What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep
    around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
  - Are you sure?
  - Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
- - Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
  - Good idea.
- - That's a fantastic idea --
  - See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls;
    then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's
    gay son went nuts on a training mission --
- - I pushed him too hard.
  - You couldn't have known --
  - Yeah, I could've. Should've.
  - You wanted to get the truth.
  - No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking
    over the little guy.
  - You mean the falsely accused?
- - You wanted to break him.
  - Yeah.
  - So did I.
- - So what now?
  - Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
  - Think it'll work?
  - Nah.
- - You know, you never told me why you left the army.
  - It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle
    of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add
    up. Plus, I got kicked out.
  - For what?
  - That's gonna stay my secret.
- - We were close to something with Kendall.
  - Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't
    by any chance grown on you, have I?
  - No.
  - Good, just making sure.
- - Four --
  - Get in.
- - We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
  - Right back where we started.
- - Hardy, what are you doing --
  - Isn't this how your story goes?
- - We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
  - Hardy, for Chrissakes --
  - WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
- - No bodies, no West...
  - No death certificates. No crime.
- - We need to talk --
  - Seven.
- - What?
  - Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't
    the guy people said".
- - This isn't the time --
  - This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of
    confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
  - What if I don't want it?
  - Tough.
- - That's not true.
  - There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
  - You're a good man, Hardy.
  - Really.
  - Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
- - West?
  - Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
- - Do I have a choice in this?
  - Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
- - What are you doing out here?
  - Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
  - Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
  - Think it'll work?
  - Nah.
  - Want company?
- - A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss?
    Probably not the best time to hit on them.
  - I should probably write that down.
  - Yeah.
- - Your phone number?
  - In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
- - He was your friend.
  - Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
- - How are you?
  - Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called
    --
  - What kind of trouble are you in?
- - That bad?
  - Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
  - Tell me what I can do.
- - This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house
    investigator.
  - And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
- - The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled
    all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in
    the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth
    week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their
    names. But the Sergeant...
  - It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
- - A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot
    out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard
    video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
  - Well, he's a good soldier.
- - The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100
    yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
  - And the problem is you only got three.
  - No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk.
    The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the
    pick-up.
  - I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
  - Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
- - Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
  - The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
  - And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
- - 'Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don''t
    have any answers for them, my career is finished --'
  - I'm not gonna let that happen.
- - He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
  - He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
- - Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
  - Who killed Pike?
  - Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
- - We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
  - There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
  - Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
  - Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and
    the trunk of my car --
  - Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
  - From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all
    that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
  - Nevertheless --
  - Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
  - Not for me.
- - You mean not enough to save you.
  - JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
- - Tom, where are you going --
  - Home, I'm done.
  - What about the confession?
- - 'You want a confession? Why don''t you confess, Bill: people are dead and you
    don''t give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking
    job, you know this is your fault --'
  - What the hell are you talking about --
  - I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base
    Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always
    he has --
- - What I said before --
  - Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
  - Yeah.
  - Does Osborne agree?
- - It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator
    myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable...
    you two had no culpability in the matter.
  - That's horseshit and you know it.
  - Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
- - You think you could explain all this to me?
  - I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another.
    He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
- - They're taking your command, aren't they?
  - The Senator...
- - I'm sorry, Bill.
  - Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
  - You're a good soldier, Bill.
  - I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
- - It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base
    Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
  - What are you talking about?
  - If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take
    care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people
    got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse,
    he'd cover for you.
  - You're drunk --
  - I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
- - Stay where you are.
  - Or what? You've gone round the bend --
  - West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
- - What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care
    of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike
    finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
  - That's preposterous --
  - Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine,
    maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it
    kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other
    person who visited Kendall.
  - I wanted to see if he was okay --
  - You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to
    crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
  - I'm not even going to dignify that --
  - No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You
    were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed
    in it --
  - You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked
    you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you
    think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one
    criminal standing in this room and it's you.
  - Not for long.
- - No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your
    signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
  - You're crazy --
  - You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong
    but I won't let this happen.
  - For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
  - Get your hands away from the desk!
- - You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
  - Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the
    beaches of Florida at risk.
- - That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe
    Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been
    a downer --
  - Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane
    to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
- - I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
  - But not the only victim, right?
  - My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better,
    I'd say you two were out to get me.
- - My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me,
    in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
  - Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
  - He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions
    to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him.
    However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What
    do you think of that?
  - I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
  - The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded,
    so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was
    gay.
- - Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this
    little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
  - You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
  - What happened to "degrees"?
  - I didn't kill him --
  - Then who did?
- - Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all.
    But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
  - But you didn't.
  - No. Poetic justice, though.
- - He admitted it.
  - Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
- - Why did he come back for you?
  - I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could,
    but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
- - Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
  - Mr. Hardy?
- - Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
  - Stop.
- - You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
  - How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
  - Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
- - Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like
    a paint mixer.
  - My heart weeps.
- - Is it the truth?
  - There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started
    shooting.
- - Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders,
    the man saved your life --
  - So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs
    shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with
    the smoking gun --
  - Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because
    I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
  - No. I said Dunbar.
  - Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was
    gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview.
    This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
- - I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
  - Well?
  - Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind.
    You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
- - Dunbar will testify that you were.
  - Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father
    do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any
    case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions,
    these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
- - Something funny, Levi?
  - I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets
    through with you.
- - Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
  - I didn't do anything --
- - Why?
  - Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
- - How do you know?
  - Because I was standing next to him.
- - Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed
    him?
  - I didn't --
  - But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
- - You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where
    to find them!
  - I don't know --
  - Where are they!
  - Maybe --
  - MAYBE WHAT --
  - Maybe he...
- - Whose blood is that, Jay?
  - West's. Any kindling for afire?
- - What do you mean, West's?
  - I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
- - Where have you been, Jay?
  - Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out
    there --  Where's West?
- - Roberto, what the fuck?
  - We just want to check your pack --
  - Why?
- - You know it's not like that --
  - Do I?
- - Right?
  - Yeah...
- - You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
  - You hated West more than any of us.
  - Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
  - You're the only one missing a grenade.
  - Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your
    pack on the ride in?
- - Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but
    you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
  - If not you, then who?
  - Mueller.
  - Oh, come on --
  - We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous
    grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
  - That's exactly what he says about you.
  - Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
- - You hated West, Mueller loved him --
  - Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
  - Bullshit.
  - Look in my pack.
  - Why?
  - Just look. Little pocket.
- - Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
  - You're lying --
  - Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
- - Why... why didn't you tell me?
  - Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast.
    Only Mueller and Childs know.
- - That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
  - You saw West, right? How was he killed?
  - Full clip to the body --
  - From up close or far away?
  - His chest was hamburger --
  - That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be
    swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
- - Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was
    gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
  - They?
  - Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the
    chopper...
- - I... I don't know...
  - What don't you know?
  - This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
- - There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab
    the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
  - No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
  - We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a
    hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial
    will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right
    now.
- - A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
  - Put it down!
- - He wouldn't kill anybody...
  - Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
  - I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but
    that doesn't mean we killed him!
- - Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
  - Why?
  - We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
- - Jesus, what happened?
  - West... he's dead.
- - Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
  - So did we. Why didn't you come?
- - So you killed him?
  - I...
- - Cadet, what's your name!
  - Sir, Dunbar, sir!
  - You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
  - Sir, yes, sir!
- - Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours!
    He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are
    to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
  - Sir, yes, sir!
  - The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
- - What the fuck is going on?
  - Your weapons, Sergeant.
- - Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
  - No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor.
    Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight,
    Command would consider you at the top of the class.
- - That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around
    0300.
  - Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
  - There were six of us...
- - He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
  - Epilepsy.
  - Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father.
    West didn't section him till last week.
- - He said he worked there --
  - No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
  - What business?
  - Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
- - Where?
  - The creek bed --
- - What about the phosphorous grenade?
  - One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
- - Back up.
  - Mueller was alone in the cabin?
  - Yeah.
- - Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
  - Would you have believed me?
- - Where's the cabin?
  - Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane
    took it away.
- - You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up
    to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
  - Can't do that now, though, can you?
- - Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
  - We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial
    in and of itself --
  - Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and
    serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing
    this uniform. Don't believe me?
- - Ohhhh, I don't think so...
  - How do you know that?
  - Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved
    them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense.
    Face it detectives... you have nothing.
- - Why not?
  - I asked for a policeman.
  - You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
  - It's... too slow.
  - Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
  - I just don't like it.
  - What do you like then?
- - I don't know... I like the Army.
  - C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated
    it here.
  - You did Basic here?
  - Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he
    used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick
    enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
- - There's no need...
  - They're dead, aren't they?
- - Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you
    want to talk more, okay?
  - Okay.
- - Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
  - I'm not telling you what happened.
  - Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like --
    nice guys?
- - Some.
  - Tell me about them.
- - And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
  - Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
- - You smoke, Ray?
  - This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette
    till I tell you more.
  - No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
- - Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three
    people!
  - That son of a bitch.
  - That'd be my reaction too --
  - He's lying.
  - Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
  - I'm serious --
- - Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now
    we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say,
    say it.
  - Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
- - So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one
    we have to blame is you --
  - I didn't shoot West --
  - Yeah, we know, Pike did.
- - I apologize --
  - You saw West's body.
  - Of course --
- - And he'd been shot.
  - Yeah --
- - You shot Childs and Nunez.
  - They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write
    a confession.
  - You saved Kendall's life --
  - But not Pike's.
- - Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the
    other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is
    just another story --
  - Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this --
    I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding
    those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
- - We're not finished yet --
  - You wanna bet?
- - We don't need the tapes --
  - Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet,
    have you?
  - We've found all of them.
- - Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
  - Jesus!
- - He -- He made me do it --
  - Do what?
  - Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
- - I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know
    the rest.
  - And the bodies?
  - You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
- - I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
  - Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
  - He's telling the truth up to a point...
- - We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
  - We don't know. West is dead.
- - What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
  - What do you mean, alone?
- - Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
  - We found him like this...
- - Yeah, right...
  - Shut up.  West's dead.
- - You too?
  - We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after
    us. That's the story.
- - This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
  - Can anybody hear me!
- - Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
  - We found him like this --
- - You killed him you fucking faggot --
  - We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
- - We got -- I don't know, we got separated
  - Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
  - I don't know!
- - Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
  - HEY!
- - West was one thing, but this --
  - Shut up, Mueller.
- - Don't you ever point a gun at me!
  - I'm -- I'm sorry...
- - A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
  - I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue
    in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
  - Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
- - Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
  - What do we do?
  - Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
- - I don't want to go --
  - Fine.
- - Did -- did you --
  - It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
- - What about Pike?
  - Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
- - He is the only one unaccounted for.
  - Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
- - You framed-him...
  - None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them.
    You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
- - Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
  - You know that was like a quadruple negative?
- - Can I at least have a drink?
  - It's ten thirty in the morning.
  - Yeah, if you've slept.
  - You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
  - Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
- - Hurricane kept you up, too?
  - Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight,
    try and get some work going.
- - Bill Styles...
  - Who?
  - Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
- - Charming Schuvaloff.
  - Black-eyed Sczortarska.
  - Dark Valdez.
  - Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
  - Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
  - And he doesn't care about me?
  - He is only curious to know who you are.
  - If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
  - He loves me, as I love you.
  - Will he wish to know the details of this night?
  - He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him
    everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
  - Tender Hegenheim.
- - I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could
    not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime;
    for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about
    in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning,
    and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
  - Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think
    my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow
    of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to
    go to the devil by a way of your own.
- - Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my
    life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady
    Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that
    I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe
    -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from
    me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
  - Would you have me spend my life all alone?
  - In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
  - The milkmaid's daughter?
  - Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or
    deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects
    the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure,
    but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who
    tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never
    comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world,
    as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
- - Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He
    was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might
    be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would
    not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove
    groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
  - Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
  - I beg your pardon?
  - Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
  - I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr.
    Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious
    matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
- - Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples,
    and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from
    my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious
    young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
  - Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply
    for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
  - He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
- - Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into
    your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady
    Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use
    it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn
    to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and
    if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you
    think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
  - Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find
    my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking
    of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife,
    getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
  - I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
  - Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over
    many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to
    apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
  - Sir, let those laugh that win.
  - I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had
    you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette
    with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James
    hang yet?
- - Did you buy the horse, papa?
  - Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
  - But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
  - Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
- - Good night, papa.
  - Good night, my little darling.
  - Papa?
  - Yes?
  - One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse,
    and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that
    true, papa?
  - What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad
    this story?
- - I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's
    farm to see him.
  - Yes, papa.
- - Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
  - Is he all right, papa?
  - Yes, he's fine.
  - Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many
    good things while you were away.
- - I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick,
    in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against
    your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the
    property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working
    lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income,
    which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge
    of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
  - Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very
    onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
  - Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible
    to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count
    yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this
    offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
  - I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
  - There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be
    executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick
    can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
  - Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
  - May I be quite frank with you?
  - Yes, of course.
  - Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear
    of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate
    any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate,
    to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point,
    and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill
    in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
  - I see.
  - When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they
    said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her
    written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in
    Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself
    the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did
    not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they
    were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon
    had been treated here.
- - What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
  - Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to
    join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a
    servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty
    people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them
    would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
- - Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my
    thong.  Have you lost much?
  - Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my
    snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
- - That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was
    in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
  - I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of
    riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
  - But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
  - O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
- - As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship
    a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your
    home?
  - That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
- - How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In
    every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question
    about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large
    fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed
    me five hundred per annum.
  - You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin,
    where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the
    honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
    with delight, my gallant young preserver.
- - Does this assignment interest you?
  - Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain
    Galgenstein.
- - Was he cheated?
  - In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money
    fairly.
  - Hmm-mmmm.
- - A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
  - The Prince left him only that choice.
- - The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
  - When is he to go?
- - Then this must be done tomorrow.
  - What is to be done?
- - And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done,
    and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord
    West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
  - Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
  - By name only.
  - Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and
    one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should
    say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement
    of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
- - Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
  - Yes!
  - Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse
    to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before
    him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man
    in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing
    your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever
    you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will
    do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in
    which I can oblige you.
- - I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
  - As much as possible.
  - As much as possible?
  - Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
  - All the same, you must name an amount.
  - It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
- - Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
  - All right, five hundred guineas.
- - I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
  - Agreed.
  - Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the
    winner.
- - I feel the ribbon.
  - Then you must get it.
- - Why are you shaking?
  - With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
- - I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because
    -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
  - I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single
    set.
  - Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with
    him into the garden?
  - I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant
    rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask
    me to dance, how could I refuse him?
  - But you refused me, Dorothy.
  - Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball
    as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man,
    and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
  - If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll
    fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
  - But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man
    of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to
    fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
- - Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge
    and the enemy on the other side.
  - I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
  - What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
  - Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim
    you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
  - Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the
    captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
- - Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But
    I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
  - Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
- - No.
  - Have you had one?
  - Never.
  - But, for a time... a passing fancy?
  - Not even that.
  - How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
  - Not one.
  - Have you not a man whom you value?
  - That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
  - What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
  - Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone
    whom I loved.
  - Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
  - Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate,
    I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware
    of it.
  - It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
  - But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good
    fortune.
  - That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
  - It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and
    it is even more difficult to make it last.
  - I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
  - A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
  - I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become
    the unhappiest of men.
  - How so?
  - By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
- - You want my heart?
  - It is my only object.
  - To make me wretched in two weeks.
  - To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
  - The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you
    love me.
  - Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know
    it, I am innocent.
  - But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power
    to love me when you love me no longer.
- - Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
  - With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest
    condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
- - And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
  - Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
  - You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed
    until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
  - Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
  - Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
  - I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding,
    obedient and discreet.
- - Will we always leave it at this?
  - Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A
    full diet can only kill it.
  - I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly
    withheld, it withers away.
  - Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago,
    now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted
    my joy by satisfying all my desires.
  - Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times
    as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
  - My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
  - Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man
    in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you
    in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul
    from enjoying your beauty.
- - Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union
    -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only
    by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me
    in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and
    arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever
    he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with
    love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
  - O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You
    have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and
    give me yours!
- - Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible
    love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than
    which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
  - Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I
    am happy.
  - As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity
    to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love
    you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did
    not know that one kiss could matter so much.
  - 'We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to
    time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"'
- - 'My Lady Cosgrove''s relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed
    in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We
    would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together
    sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the
    water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly
    burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:'
  - Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so
    wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the
    least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not
    give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest
    fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have
    wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From
    the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence;
    but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my
    own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you
    want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that
    at least, you will gently us me.
- - Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
  - Old fool!
- - I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this
    lady.
  - Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
  - Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am
    not of a humor to put up with rivals.
  - Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
  - Then you yield to me.
  - On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
  - Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
  - That is a trifle strong.
  - Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
- - You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
  - Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
- - Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
  - Yes, sir.
  - You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
  - Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
  - For whom else have you worked?
  - No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness
    of the loins.
  - Who else can give me information about you?
  - Only the agency of servants.
- - And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred;
    for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the
    old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
  - I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields,
    and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
- - The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay
    out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only
    way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me,
    why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand
    the cards?
  - I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
  - We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two
    worth knowing.
- - But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
  - Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
  - I believe they will deport you.
  - I have faced that problem before.
  - But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
  - Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last
    look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in
    Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the
    country, and, out of it, you shall go.
  - But how, sir?
- - Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence
    we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three
    Kings at Dresden?
  - Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I
    need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
- - When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins,
    and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
  - Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three
    months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will
    meet you.
- - It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
  - To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
  - I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
  - Certain?
  - Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
- - Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
  - I will let down the steps for your honor.
- - Good gracious!  What is this?
  - You are going to drive to the frontier.
  - It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's
    house.
  - I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing
    ten thousand frederics if you do not.
  - Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
  - Your honor must lower his voice.
  - All Europe shall hear of this!
  - As you please.
- - I have no luggage.
  - The gentleman has nothing contraband.
- - Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
  - I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
  - I don't know.
  - Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
  - Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will
    be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
  - Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable
    and lucrative occupation.
  - I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes
    you wish.  Good night.
- - Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my
    wife.
  - I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all
    her ladyship's money and pearls.
  - Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in
    this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your
    good father?
  - Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my
    family.
  - Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close
    friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
  - Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
  - I have heard of them.
- - Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
  - Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
  - You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
  - Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
  - Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You
    change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into
    the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends
    the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry
    of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept
    your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
- - This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
  - The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
- - Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before
    he marries her!
  - Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
- - A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle
    to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen
    hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand
    pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a
    girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these
    ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your
    uncle as to your father.
  - And so I am.
  - And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his
    house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free,
    your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
  - Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to
    the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet
    him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message
    to him, and arrange the meeting?
  - Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty
    I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass
    of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge,
    strong fellow.
  - He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
  - In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give
    me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives,
    you shall never want a friend or a second.
- - Have you taken my message to him?
  - The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
  - My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
  - Your cousins go out with him.
- - That's a very handsome sword you have there.
  - It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met
    Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through
    the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in
    liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
  - And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in
    the world.
  - I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
- - I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's
    body.
  - Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
  - I'll match any man with the sword.
  - But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee
    against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce
    move it now.
  - Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
  - It must have been some other gate.
- - Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best,
    mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best
    is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a
    mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas
    at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
  - A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before
    I apologize.
- - Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance
    and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters,
    and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my
    family.
  - I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son,
    but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not
    write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
  - I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to
    ask for them at the post office.
  - We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married
    to "Brown Bess."
- - I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
  - Is Miss Dugan well?
  - There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
  - Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
  - She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with
    a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
  - Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
  - No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit
    him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the
    Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan
    of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly
    Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you
    certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow
    was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story
    afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
  - The coward!
  - He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That
    coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business
    was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight,
    though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and
    the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You
    may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share
    and, while they last, you shall never want.
- - My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions
    about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to
    say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand
    stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the
    British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter
    of recommendation to him.
  - What is your uncle's name?
  - O'Grady.
  - Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
- - This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
  - This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach
    is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
  - Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
- - Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
  - The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
  - The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
- - Where's the beauty you promised me?
  - It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier
    woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait
    awhile.
- - Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
  - I have acted as I think fit.
  - Sir, I'm a British officer.
  - It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have
    confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been
    dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you
    don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
  - Neither!
- - Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle,
    Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
  - How do you do, sir?
- - The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein,
    a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
  - Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well --
    and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us;
    if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army,
    and a bounty of 100 guineas.
  - What is the service, sir?
  - There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen,
    who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star
    of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging,
    a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent
    and discreet.
- - You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in
    the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
  - Only a very little, as soldiers do.
  - I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He
    sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either
    ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much
    each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read
    his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble
    yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding
    out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys
    of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you
    get an impression of the keys.
- - What are the Chevalier's intentions?
  - I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the
    money, he would have to fight for it.
- - Has he sent the challenge yet?
  - Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
- - You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his
    carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his
    orders to move on.
  - And his baggage?
  - Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which
    contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You
    will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me
    at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a
    clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
- - Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
  - I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and
    your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
  - Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
  - It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll
    thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young
    lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
  - Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
  - I never was more in earnest.
- - And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I
    ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I
    am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
  - If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
- - Both of us ride home with Best here.
  - I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
  - You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but
    Michael and I will see you home for all that.
- - There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
  - Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
  - Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when
    I count three, fire.
- - Good day to you, young sir.
  - Good morning.
  - Where are you bound for?
  - That is none of your business.
  - Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as
    you travel?
  - Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution,
    and are ready to do it again.
- - People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
  - Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
- - A lot?
  - Enough.
- - So what's up with you?
  - What do you want to know?
  - The good stuff.
  - I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
  - What else?
  - Are you trying to rap to me?
- - This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
  - Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
  - Oh you do, huh?
  - Just a little something' somethin'.
  - I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
  - Gots no intention of ending up broke.
  - Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You
    ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
  - No, before my time.
  - You don't read, do you?
  - Never read a book in my whole life.
  - Maybe you need to start.
  - Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
  - Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were
    considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution
    of the United States?
- - Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of
    the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all
    this.  You down with Delacroix.
  - I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
  - We can look out for ourselves.
- - Why don't you call him?
  - For what?  He left.  Not me.
- - You're sure this is a good idea.
  - My people love me.
- - I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
  - Y'know what?
  - What?
  - You look beautiful like that.
- - How did you get this gig?
  - Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
  - You leave something out?
  - After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his
    assistant.
  - And?
  - And what?
  - Stop playing me Sloan.
  - Just ask me what you want to know.
  - Oh, you gonna make me say it.
  - Say what, Manray?
  - Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
  - We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything
    I've got I've earned.
  - Aw, c'mon.
  - That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
- - So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to
    the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm
    damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
  - Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
  - Don't try to change to the subject.
  - Why don't you answer?
  - I know I won't be your puppet.
  - You can go now.
  - I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
- - This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
  - And this is my very best friend Mantan.
- - We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
  - '...the big apple, New York, New York.'
  - To come back to our roots.
  - Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
  - No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons
    and high cotton?
  - Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
  - Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
  - Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
- - Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell,
    I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids
    infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome
    Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired,
    you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing,
    whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking,
    football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids
    from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
  - You tellin' the truth.
  - Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside
    your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND
    I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
- - Y'know my lady Lucindy?
  - The one with da big...
  - Not her, the one with the little...
  - Oh her.
  - Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
- - No, not that.  How 'bout...
  - She hates dem.
  - Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
  - Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
  - Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
  - '...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.'
  - That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
- - Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
  - I thought you got rid of...
  - '...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...'
  - '...dat''s too much money.  I can''t ''ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost
    no mo'' than...'
  - '...aconite get it dat cheap.'
  - I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take
    her out to dinner.
  - We should go out on a double date.
- - I heard ya lady is wild.
  - No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
  - Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
  - '...no, she didn''t...'
  - '...yes she did.'
  - '...I heard different, thought that was...'
  - '...not that time...'
  - So when are you comin' to pick us up?
  - Around...
  - '...too early...'
  - '...then what about...'
  - '...too late, maybe around...'
  - '...perfect...'
  - That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
  - '...like macaroni and cheese...'
  - '...like grits and butter...'
  - '...like fried and chicken...'
- - I fell out of my bed last night.
  - You slept too near where you got in?
  - I slept too near where I fell out.
  - You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
- - Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
  - Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for
    all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
  - Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
  - Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
  - Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
  - How be dat?
  - I don't know who I am.
  - Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
  - Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us
    often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my
    son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife.
    Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother
    in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife
    also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild
    for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because
    she was my mother's mother.
- - Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And
    lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I
    Mantan, became my own grandfather.
  - Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
- - I feel a song a comin' on.
  - A song a comin' I feel.
- - Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for
    coming in.
  - Tavis, thank you for having me.
  - Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television
    interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley,
    whatnot but you're here.
  - I'm more comfortable around my people.
  - Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked
    a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
  - Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about
    the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
- - Money and nothing else?
  - Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout.
    Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned
    how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
  - Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
  - No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting
    isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one
    hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
  - Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
  - I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel
    Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This
    is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like
    everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and
    they're laughing at the same time.
  - I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before
    we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE

- - I never had a really real pair before.
  - You've never had any formal training, either?
  - Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
  - I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
  - You sing and dance?
  - A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
  - So what's up with you and DeLa?
  - What do you mean?
  - Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
- - No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU,
    DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
  - I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like
    that.
  - If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
  - You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
  - Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
  - I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really
    doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
  - I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
- - I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in
    this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna
    Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
  - First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents
    marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
- - Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
  - The best defense is offense.
- - The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African
    Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three.
    Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines
    what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F"
    'em.
  - We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
- - Let Myrna finish.
  - Thank you.  And always smile.
- - Yes you!
  - This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End
    of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
- - Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
  - I just turned twenty.
- - Where are you from?
  - Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
  - Finland.
  - You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
  - Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real
    conversation with a real Negro before?
  - What's a Negro.
- - A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
  - Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
  - Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
  - Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
  - Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by
    side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
- - How did you get this gig?
  - My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
  - This is a TV show, not a music video.
  - Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if
    that's possible, no?
  - This is a travesty.  A debacle.
- - Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
  - Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
- - You must think I'm some kind of fool.
  - It looks delicious.
  - You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is
    wrong.
  - C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
  - I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
- - How's the food?
  - Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have
    a new show, a pilot being shot.
  - That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
- - It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
  - If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
  - Mommy, please don't call me that.
  - Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change
    your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
  - I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
  - I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes
    in it without being buffoons?
  - To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition
    of buffoons?
  - Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
  - Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
  - I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked
    very hard.  You deserve it.
- - Peerless, your father called.
  - I'll be right over.
- - He wants you to come and see him.
  - He said that?
  - Yes he did.
  - Where is he?
  - He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
  - I can't go all the way down south.
- - Richmond is not all the way down south.
  - I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
  - Regardless, he still is your father.
  - It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
  - Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
  - C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From
    winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
  - Peerless, last time, go see your father.
- - I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched
    it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be
    no buffoonery.
  - You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
  - Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
  - Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
  - No.
  - Not at all?
  - You know how your Daddy is.
  - If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
  - I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
  - Soon.
- - I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure
    is on.
  - Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This
    is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter
    and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime
    soon, now that there is some pressure.
  - I didn't mean it to sound like that.
- - That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been
    in want, in need your entire privileged life?
  - Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because
    I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm
    proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind
    of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
  - The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun
    doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
- - Can I kiss you too?
  - Naw.  I'll take the zero.
  - You feel good, not nervous?
  - I feel fine.
  - Not nervous?  Relaxed?
  - Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
- - So they can be on TV.
  - You sound like the media.
  - This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
  - Same thing Giuliani said.
  - Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides,
    there is no such thing as bad publicity.
- - No joke.  Serious.
  - Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
  - In time.
- - What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
  - No.
  - You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
  - Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
- - You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should
    never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
  - Yeah.
  - And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
- - You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
  - What you did is dead wrong.
  - Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
  - Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
  - Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first
    place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is
    an opportunity.
  - I don't believe it.
  - Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
- - Mantan, we got a show to tape.
  - My name is Manray, goddamnit.
  - Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing
    room, get dressed and blacken up.
- - Yes, your name?
  - He, I'm Mona.
  - Hi, Mona.
  - I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to
    your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this
    pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge
    us based only on our whiteness.
  - Oh, is that what I'm doing?
- - This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be
    near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole
    lot of work.
  - David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk
    out loud.
  - I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
- - How was it?
  - Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
  - Nobody told me anything.
  - What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
  - It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
- - Manray!
  - Manray!
- - How did you know?
  - It hit me like a ton of bricks.
  - How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
  - The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
- - Manray was under our nose the whole time.
  - Do you know how you will use him?
  - Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
- - You lost me.
  - Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going
    to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence
    I'll prove my point.
  - What point is that?
  - The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless
    they are buffoons.
  - Sounds risky to me.
  - You getting cold feet?
  - I'm in till the end.
  - Good.  I'm going to need your support.
  - Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
  - And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's
    what I intend to do.
- - Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
  - Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can
    do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
- - Hello.
  - This is Cheeba.
- - You okay?
  - I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
- - What is your problem?
  - My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
  - Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
  - It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I
    take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from
    my money.
  - Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love
    from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about
    you.  So now what are you gonna do?
- - Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that
    could be more dangerous.
  - What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
  - I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock
    and a hard place.
  - Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty,
    he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
- - Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running
    things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
  - Hello.
  - I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be
    starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold
    my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being
    hired.
- - This is the group I was telling you about.
  - Which one is your brother?
  - The big one.
- - You've said that already.
  - I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
- - Just want to say good luck.
  - Break a leg.
- - Your life will never be the same.
  - Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
  - We both lied to him.
  - What do you want me to say?
  - Just don't lie to me.
- - Same here.
  - The pleasure is mine.
- - I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed
    them on you.
  - C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You
    gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance,
    a shot.  He got his.
- - Who's side are you on?
  - I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
- - What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
  - Everybody shut up.
- - So you have your small victory, now what?
  - A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
- - What is this?
  - A gift.
  - For what?
  - No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
- - The Jolly Nigger Bank.
  - This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
  - Thanks.
  - I thought it was appropiate.
  - Is that good or bad?
  - It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these
    old black collectibles.
  - How so?
  - To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered
    inferior, sub-human.
- - Why'd you do that?
  - I don't want to hear it.
  - How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
  - You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
  - That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
  - He's just playing big brother.
  - Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
  - Please don't go there.
  - Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all
    messed up.
  - I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
  - Do you have to be so damn forthright?
- - DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
  - Light?
  - That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
  - You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I
    know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically
    with somebody crazier than you.
- - This is crazy.
  - That's why it will be so much fun.
- - That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
  - The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see
    Mantan anymore.
  - Work related or otherwise?
- - Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished
    at NYU.
  - DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
  - And that's how you got me in the first place.
- - Don't make me have to use this.
  - I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
- - I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
  - Give me the gun.
- - Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
  - Is that so?
- - How long has my father been like this?
  - Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
  - So he drank himself into a stuper?
  - The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
  - So what's up with you?
  - I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed
    so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been
    together ever since.
- - Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
  - Your father is proud of you.
- - He never showed it.
  - He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
- - What do you want?
  - I want to speak with you.
  - Go away, unless you got my money.
  - It's me, Peerless.
- - Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
  - It's been a long time.
  - Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
  - Pleased to meet you.
- - Good woman.  I trained her right.
  - Daddy, she's younger than me.
  - My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
- - Purely for medicinal purposes.
  - I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
- - I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
  - How did you end up here?
  - How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in
    West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
- - That's what I'm askin'.
  - Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some
    material I refused to do.
  - Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
- - That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
  - Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
  - All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's
    too short" category.
- - Enough about me, what's happening with you?
  - The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
- - Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
  - Nuthin' I can't handle.
  - The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
  - Where do you go from here?
  - Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
  - I didn't mean that, in life.
  - In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman,
    make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all
    nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
- - Let's get him over to the bed.
  - Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never
    gave me no trouble.
- - I love you too, Daddy.
  - Always keep 'em laughing.
- - '...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.'
  - I'm sorry I'm late.
  - Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
  - I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
- - Four minutes ago.
  - So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
  - I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
- - Do you know what C.P. Time is?
  - C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are
    always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to
    music or dance.
- - I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
  - I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
  - Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're
    hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing
    for me.
- - I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the
    truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please
    don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife
    and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't
    give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty
    Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
  - I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
  - NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
- - The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black
    faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down
    that road again.
  - I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for
    a dramatic series or sitcom.
  - I'm telling you it's not.
- - The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle
    class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The
    middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class
    single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black
    mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
  - '...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.'
- - Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was
    because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that
    junk.
  - I've never been given a fair shot.
  - You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious
    ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin',
    trying to be white.
  - I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE,
    SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger"
    show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that
    what you think?
  - That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want
    to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf,
    dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I
    know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These
    idiots have to be led to the water.
  - I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
  - You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I
    need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
- - What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes
    place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of
    junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
  - Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions
    and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I
    want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of
    you if it kills you.
- - Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
  - It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know
    my assistant, Sloan.
- - We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
  - I'm wid it.
  - I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous
    work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As
    Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button
    in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to
    live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
  - Go on.  Good so far.
  - I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the
    19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing,
    dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time
    there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
- - Word!!!
  - So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into
    the 21st century, into the new millennium.
  - The name of the show?
  - 'It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.'
  - I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is
    hard, no disrespect my sister.
- - I'm feelin' dis'!
  - It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this
    on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed
    too risque, too controversial.
  - Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can
    Whoopi sing or dance?
  - I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
  - Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan
    again?
- - That's a great handle.
  - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's
    satire.
  - I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
- - Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and
    Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
  - What are there character traits?
  - Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
  - Exactly!
  - Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity
    makes his best laid plans go haywire.
  - And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
  - Yep, you guessed it.
  - This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
- - Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting
    on.
  - Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
- - Negroes would be in an uproar.
  - So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No
    such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
  - Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
  - Who are the other characters?
  - Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo,
    Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
- - We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
  - In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
  - Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything,
    movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium
    Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
- - And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make
    us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
  - I don't know about that plantation angle.
  - What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What
    does everybody else think about this?
- - That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
  - We think so.
  - Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
- - I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high
    wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a
    Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous
    terrain.
  - To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's
    un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
- - I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
  - I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that
    hot new sexy Madonna video.
  - You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
  - I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
  - Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
  - Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider
    has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know
    what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities
    are endless.
  - What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new
    sexy freaky Madonna video?
  - If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct
    the Mantan pilot.
  - That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
  - No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose
    your own musical director.  You can have that.
- - In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
  - Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been
    a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you
    want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
- - I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
  - Dunwitty, don't leave.
- - I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the
    way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
  - Calm down, please.
- - I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond
    ass came from.
  - We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
  - Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok,
    the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's
    see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
  - I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people
    better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them
    inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
- - Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the
    pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement,
    ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
  - They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
  - This has to be a big mistake.
  - The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo,
    from jump street.
  - Hold on a sec, I got a call.
  - Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
  - I gots to go, it's my Moms.
  - I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla
    Ice.
- - Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial
    TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the
    community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such
    feelings?
  - Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no
    problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to
    mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any
    way, shape or form should be censored.
  - No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
  - Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say
    this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
  - But the line has to be drawn.
  - Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred
    years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always
    crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
  - Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
  - Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went
    to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
- - Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
  - Well do something about it.
- - My tap shoes.
  - EUREKA!!
- - What do I have to do?
  - Some tap dancing, some singing.
  - Where do I sign?
- - How different?
  - Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer
    one way or the other.
  - DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
  - That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
- - I would like to change your name.
  - To what?
  - You're now Mantan.
  - Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some
    new kicks.
- - I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
  - Why?
  - You have to start getting into your character.
- - Mantan?
  - Mantan!!
- - I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
  - How you sound?
  - I won't do it anymore.
  - Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me
    no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel
    you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You
    gotta be professional.
  - I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
  - No costume.  No blackface.
- - I'm starvin' like Marvin.
  - My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
  - Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
  - Did we get our bill yet?
- - Ahh, the luxuries of life.
  - Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much
    Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
  - Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
  - And I'm the feet.
  - Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango
    - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
  - I'm tired of waiting.
- - We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about
    our savings?
  - Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go
    to the hoosegow?
- - We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
  - We was coming to see you.
  - If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
  - We're starving.
- - That ain't funny.
  - DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
- - Good morning, Cheeba.
  - Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
  - De-la-croix.
  - Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
- - Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
  - You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
  - No offense.
  - Manray needs a job.
- - I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but
    regardless, you'll still make some money.
  - How much?
  - First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
- - What kind of show is this gonna be?
  - Different.
- - What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
  - You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
- - Nice to meet you.
  - And this is Manray.
- - Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't
    you?  Trust me on this one.
  - We might need some mo' money behind this.
  - That can be done.
- - Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
  - You might be right.
  - Why are you smiling so?
- - I'm not smiling.
  - Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
  - It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
  - No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what
    we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
  - Certified ladies' man, huh?
  - She's also moorish.
- - What's that?
  - Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
  - Seconds and thirds, too.
  - Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
  - You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
  - Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
- - DeLa - what's the matter with you.
  - You ain't happy about the green light?
- - What's wrong with him?
  - Must be the pressure.
- - Please, have a seat.
  - Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
  - In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
- - Why they gotta make my nose so big?
  - Look at my lips.
- - I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
  - What are you talkin' about?
  - Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
  - Meaning?
  - I'm out.
  - Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
  - So that's what you been doing?
  - Damn skippy.
  - You're in this up till ya neck.
  - Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
  - You can walk away.  We both can.
  - Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
  - I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm
    a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
- - Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
  - Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan
    you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
- - And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
  - What do I do?
  - What do you do?
  - I'm a revolutionary.
- - And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
  - Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree
    without making threats.
- - The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
  - What's your name?
  - My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
  - And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
  - We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be
    scientists.  We drop science.
- - We're ready when you are.
  - Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give
    my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
- - You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
  - I didn't mean to scare you like that.
  - Well you did.
  - Give me some?
  - I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
  - Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you
    better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
  - I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
  - BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
- - Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
  - I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
- - My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
  - Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want
    to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
  - So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci,
    Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
  - Who are you revolting against?
  - We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and
    hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about
    the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
  - Please.
  - If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's
    his name again?
  - Delacroix.
  - Yeah, him.
  - What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
  - C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on
    TV.  We got underground cult following.
- - You don't have the demographics.
  - So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set
    up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood,
    hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
  - That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother,
    for you or anybody else.
  - There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days,
    you would be classified as a house nigga.
  - If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways
    to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took
    ya field nigga ass out of my house.
  - My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't
    bother letting me out.
  - That's mighty black of you.
- - Everybody say Ho!
  - Ho!
  - That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to
    welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
- - My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for
    me?
  - Yeah!
  - I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real
    coons know you're ready to start the show.
- - C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different
    'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
  - YEAH!
  - Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
  - Let's go NIGGERS.
- - Let's go niggers!
  - Louder.  They can't hear you.
- - Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
  - How 'bout...
- - BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
  - B-L-A-K it is.
- - Keep trying.
  - I'm on it.
- - '...Benedict Arnold...'
  - '...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those
    two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep ''N Eat, y''knowwhatI''msayin''?'
- - Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
  - We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not
    this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
  - 1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
- - He gots to be did.
  - Did he gots to be.
- - You truly are a dancing fool.
  - Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
- - Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession.
    Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that
    happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver
    stil.
  - Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you
    would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your
    being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something
    wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of
    guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity
    or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
- - Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must
    listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve
    me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms
    to serve God?
  - It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that
    I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms
    still hurt.
  - I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the
    Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly
    moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs
    to serve God?
  - I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
  - As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday
    morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
  - Yes, Sister?
  - Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him.
    Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last
    time, and will never use again. My vagina.
- - Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like
    many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all
    the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play
    in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
  - You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names
    of these -- good boys you knew?
- - I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
  - All right. What are you gonna do?
  - I want 15 on the Mets.
  - How about 7 1/2?
- - Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking
    lock. I wanna make some money.
  - Are you sure?
  - Yeah. I'm sure.
- - OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
  - I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
  - Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
  - I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
  - Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
  - There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry
    is ready to break out.
- - Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
  - That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
- - Do you have the money?
  - What money?
  - Don't bullshit me.
- - I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
  - This psycho can.
  - Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
  - You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the
    fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up.
    You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
  - Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
- - You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
  - Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking
    house and --
  - He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
  - I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking
    blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
- - How's the case going?
  - What case?
  - The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from
    the Church! Remember?
  - Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
  - That 50 G could help you --
- - Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry!
    Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at
    him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole
    stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on
    purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood
    for the very first time that --
  - You've really got a problem.
- - -- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way.
    So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big
    One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
  - Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him
    wnat you want.
- - Large?
  - All right, cop. I want my money.
  - It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead,
    you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
  - What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
  - Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
  - Let me think about it.
  - There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting
    nothing.
- - Oh, really?
  - Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
  - OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message.
    Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job
    on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to
    me. 100 G cash. Get it?
- - 'Here''s the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At
    the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We''ll listen to the end of the game together.
    You bring your cash, I''ll bring mine.'
  - Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
- - I forgive you.
  - Me?
  - I forgive you.
  - You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been
    bad. Real bad.
  - I forgive you.
  - Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
- - I forgive you.
  - Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate
    me!
  - I forgive you.
  - Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year
    after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on
    my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in
    my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over,
    that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing.
    Why?
- - I forgive you.
  - Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to
    death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
- - Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned.
    It's still goddamn good to be good.
  - I forgive you.
- - That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
  - What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do
    your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
  - The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
  - Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
- - How are you doing, man?
  - Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
- - There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after
    tomorrow, right?
  - Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
  - I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
- - You took the chalice.
  - Yes.
  - You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
  - Yes.
- - Are you all right, honey?
  - I was gonna bring it back myself.
- - So what are you doing here?
  - He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
  - That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those
    boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't
    what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
- - I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and
    you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker!
    You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
  - Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
  - It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash
    to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment,
    man. She could make serious money!
- - Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
  - Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have,
    Lieutenant...
- - I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
  - They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss,
    just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts
    up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime
    if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like
    shit they would.
  - Susie's not a virgin anymore.
  - She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
- - It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
  - Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured
    first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's
    all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
- - The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the
    racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt
    Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out.
    Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
  - I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you
    believe in God?
  - What's to believe?
  - That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
- - People.
  - You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
  - Yeah.
  - OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
- - It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta
    believe me!
  - Why?
- - Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
  - Who?
  - Those fucking Mob assholes.
- - C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
  - Yeah.
  - Then c'mere. I got something for you.
- - First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna
    add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must
    know that...  First time shooting up?
  - Nah...
  - Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
- - Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then,
    he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
  - Who?
  - A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
- - But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
  - You mean you could use it.
- - I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church!
    Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while,
    I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking
    to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it
    -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick
    up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
  - '"The Strawberries"?'
  - The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's
    almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask
    the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah.
    Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought
    to --
- - How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come
    up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
  - I'm a Catholic.
- - Alderman Swayzak.
  - Investigator Rimgale.
  - I need to get in the trunk.
- - Inspector.
  - Alderman.
- - When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
  - '"Don?"'
  - Don't you have any leads at all?
  - No Marty, I don't.
- - We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
  - Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn
    high-rise!
  - Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
- - Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
  - Just catch the son of a bitch.
- - Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
  - Investigator...
- - I'm a little busy right now --
  - This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about
    this --
- - Got a cause?
  - Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have
    a stroke.
  - The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
- - I'm working on it.
  - I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What
    happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
  - '...He wasn''t listening to the right thing...'
  - What do you listen to, Stephen?
  - You don't know... nobody knows...
  - I might.
- - It knows us. This one knows us.
  - I need that report, Lt.
- - Shadow.
  - How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
  - Didn't think you'd make it.
  - Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
  - Who's this?
  - He works for me.
  - Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
  - You like everybody, Ronald.
- - You don't know him.
  - I know you.
- - Knock it off. Now.
  - Tell him about me, Shadow?
  - Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker
    and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald?
    When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day
    care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
  - Did he tell you how we finally met?
  - Nobody cares, Ronald.
  - Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
- - Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
  - Absolutely.
- - -- Burn them.
  - And old ladies?
  - -- Burn them.
  - And the world -- the whole world.
  - -- Burn it all.
- - They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination
    of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light
    it.
  - Putty? On both doors?
  - There's something else kinda interesting...
- - Anyway, down here, take a look...
  - McCaffrey, hold this for us.
- - See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro.
    On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here
    had ever heard of it.
  - Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents.
    It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
  - Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
  - What the hell was it doing in the fire?
  - That's your job.
- - Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
  - Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
- - You can't talk about my brother like that...
  - Here we go...
- - Stephen, what are you doing here?
  - Fixing my roof.
  - It's not your roof anymore.
- - Where's Sean?
  - He's got piano lessons.
  - Oh yeah? How's he doing?
  - He's going to be a fireman.
  - Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
  - Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
  - I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially
    since I don't remember much of it --
  - -- You remember.
  - Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
  - The great communicator.
  - Sorry I hit Jackson.
  - He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
  - He treats you okay?
  - Okay.
  - I treated you better.
  - You treated me like shit.
- - You want some coffee?
  - Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
  - What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your
    mind.  How's Brian doing?
  - He's out.
  - I know he's out, but how's he doing?
  - Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates
    my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
  - Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be
    right.
  - Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
  - Yeah? When was the last time?
  - In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going
    to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened.
    And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
  - You can't keep being his father...
- - I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
  - What's wrong?
  - I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was
    there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire
    department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't
    leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till
    death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without
    that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when
    the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm
    sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I
    miss you.
- - Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
  - Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
- - Look, I'm sorry I --
  - -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
  - -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the
    piano.
  - I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
- - I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
  - Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
- - Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
  - I'm busy.
  - He just wants to --
  - -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
- - We gotta roll, Stevie...
  - I'll be there.
  - They're waitin' man.
  - I'll be there, goddamn it!
- - Who's going to die?
  - Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
  - Well, let's have a look.
- - Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and
    you'd get burned.
  - And DIE!
- - Fireman shit?
  - Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
  - Firehouse.
  - Cute.
- - Dad!
  - You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be
    back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
- - Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you
    buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's
    a fire department uniform.
  - It's in my blood, Willy.
- - Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look
    forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant
    Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
  - Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
  - Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about
    six months wasn't it?
  - Management were pin heads.
  - '"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?'
  - Coffee sucked.
  - And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
  - I was ahead of my time.
  - You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
- - Completely out of control.
  - What the hell are we waiting for?
- - Aren't you even curious?
  - Engine 115, right?
  - How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
  - Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
  - You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
  - Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list,
    half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy.
    115's the station.
  - Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and
    your brother?
- - Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
  - Backdraft.
- - Do you have to do that?
  - Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin'
    that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround
    and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see
    how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
- - Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You
    never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this
    job or be great at it".
  - Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little
    gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
- - What?
  - '"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind
    of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to
    double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez,
    a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence
    as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene
    of his father''s death..."'
- - So, you surviving without me?
  - There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If
    someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
  - Swayzak's not my boss.
- - Yeah. Big fan.
  - And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
  - Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
  - No need to be modest, Brian.
  - No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
  - -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires
    together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his
    command.
  - Every little boy's fantasy.
  - Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
  - I have a job.
  - 'This one''s still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don
    Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could
    use another pair of hands and you''re exactly the kind of guy I want representing
    us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.'
  - Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
  - Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could
    be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
- - Mr. McCaffrey...
  - Nice boat.
  - It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
- - Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
  - Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's
    arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know
    what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
- - Brian?
  - Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
  - You look like... Brian.
- - '''Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?'
  - Four months.
  - Four months?
  - I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
- - That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
  - Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
  - Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
  - Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
- - Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
  - Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
- - Oh, man, I'm sorry.
  - You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
- - Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
  - Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
- - Are you still here?
  - Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
  - Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
  - I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by
    the city.
  - Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't
    mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's
    the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with
    me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You
    think you're the first?
- - Where are you going?
  - Pest control.
- - -- Shhh.
  - What are you listening to?
- - So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned
    wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
  - Glass?
  - Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
- - Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack
    of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow
    burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made
    you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out...
    but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead...
    still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door
    and give it that one gulp of air...
  - -- Another backdraft.
- - Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is
    melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of
    created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
  - No it couldn't.
- - Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
  - I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
- - Read.
  - '"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"'
  - -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
  - '"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates.
    Will consume magnesium".'
  - Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
- - Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all
    to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless
    you could find something that would eat its residue.
  - Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
- - Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but
    we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
  - And the putty around the door?
  - Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would
    go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
  - But the right guess on this is arson.
  - I don't guess.
  - Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
  - I don't work for them, either.
- - That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this
    tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
  - What?
  - I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world.
    But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns
    were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made
    his burns backdrafts.
  - But he killed these guys.
  - But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading
    in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
  - What reason?
  - Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble
    to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
  - That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
  - No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
  - Are you going public with this?
  - No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
- - What the hell are you doing here?
  - I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to
    help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
- - In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
  - Fire.
- - Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled
    by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners
    are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
  - Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
- - So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
  - And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into
    real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
  - Nice bunch of guys.
  - Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this
    somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
- - This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this
    job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all
    airtight.
  - Yeah? Airtight?
- - I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're
    all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
  - Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly
    one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees,
    no directors, just a PO Box.
  - Then who wrote the report?
  - It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's
    the connection?
- - Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
  - How ya feeling?
- - Did you pull me out?
  - Yeah.
  - Did I say thanks?
  - No.
  - Just wondering.
  - I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
- - So what do you want me to do?
  - I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking
    in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right
    place...
- - Your brother was a good man.
  - Yeah.
  - Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going
    to read?  You're the only one that knows.
  - Like it never happened...
- - If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
  - You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think
    we forgot that? You think I did?
  - I want another shot, Sir.
  - Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe
    to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take
    you back?
  - If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
  - -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a
    good firemen, but you had your shot.
  - I need another one, sir.
  - Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
  - No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you
    have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
  - Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation.
    That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
  - See you Monday. Sir.
- - Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to
    the animal, huh?
  - Hey, do I know you?
- - I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
  - So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after
    all...
- - Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
  - Who's doing this?
  - Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage.
    And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
  - Then who --
  - -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
  - I don't have a story.
  - Sure you do.
- - Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What
    did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
  - What?
  - You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
  - I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium
    deal.
  - Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So
    young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the
    fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling,
    Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
  - -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
  - Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through
    his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to
    you if you listen.
  - The outlets.
  - That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
  - Trychticholorate.
  - Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's
    another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did
    you see him burn?
- - Who the fuck is doing this?
  - After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to
    you?...
- - Oh Jesus Christ...
  - Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
- - Brian.
  - Jennifer.
  - You're back.
  - You look great.
  - Thanks for calling.
  - Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
  - Huh.
  - So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
  - Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
  - Yeah? What have you been up to?
  - I work for city hall.
  - Really? No kidding.
  - What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn
    once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
- - Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
  - I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
- - With grenadine, right?
  - When I was twenty.
  - Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
- - Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around
    you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
  - Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
  - Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
  - Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
  - Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department.
    You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West
    Side --
  - -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
  - Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job,
    you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
- - What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
  - Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching
    the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
  - I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
- - Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
  - C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
  - Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
  - So now you suddenly care about my future?
  - Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd
    call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this
    garbage between us.
  - Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be
    a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke
    eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk
    to one of them.
- - I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still
    on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
  - '...Okay. I''ll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty''s a good
    man, Brian.'
  - Yeah...
- - Arson.
  - Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
- - Hey.
  - How's it going?
  - Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
  - Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd
    really like you to come.
  - I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
- - I could use a date.
  - Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
- - Hi.
  - Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
  - If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy,
    you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
  - Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
  - You think that's really any of your business?
  - Well, you did invite me here.
  - Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
- - Okay.
  - Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
  - No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of
    balls on this one.
  - Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were
    killed by accidents or not.
  - Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found
    some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've
    maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's
    locked.
  - But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
  - In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
- - Thanks for the invite.
  - Got anything to drink in there?
  - Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
- - This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up
    in here. What do you think?
  - Homey.
  - See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn
    engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
  - Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
  - When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
  - Then why did you quit?
  - I wanted to be a good one.
- - Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression
    equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion
    into the hose.
  - Uh huh.
- - Brian. What's wrong?
  - You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
  - I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the
    city and its investigators --
  - -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
  - Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
  - -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All
    for a couple's political points.
  - I was doing my job.
  - Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
  - Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson
    because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there,
    remember? I saw you and your brother --
  - Leave Stephen out of this --
  - Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for
    Swayzak --
  - -- I work for the city.
  - You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now.
    The fit isn't right.
- - Hi.
  - Hi.
  - We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
  - Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why
    he keeps that hidden.
  - I don't know anything about it.
  - You could check. It'd be in his files.
  - Do you know what you're asking me to do?
  - Yes.
  - Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing
    Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed
    in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
  - Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
- - What is --
  - Just take it.
- - I'm sorry.
  - That's a dumb thing to say.
  - You're right.
- - I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
  - I quit two days ago, Brian.
  - What'll you do?
  - I don't have the slightest idea...
  - I'll see ya around, huh?
  - It's a small town.
- - It doesn't go like that.
  - Who asked you?
  - If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
- - Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
  - I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration
    to me.
  - So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
- - Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
  - Not likely.
  - Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided
    in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the
    other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One
    case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
- - I like what you've done with the place.
  - It's comin' along... want a beer?
- - Been ripping off fire stations?
  - It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway.
    Still good enough though for this tub.
- - My God, an actual operating 8-track.
  - What, you've never seen one before?
  - In the Field Museum once.
  - It works.
  - It worked when you were in sixth grade.
- - People actually used to pay you for this?
  - Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
  - Sheep don't count.
  - Yeah? What about Laura --
  - That was never proved.
- - Why'd you come here, Brian?
  - I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really
    gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe
    and I'm still pissed" games?
  - What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and
    amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe
    you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the
    family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
  - Hey! You don't know me --
  - I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for
    awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling
    log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good
    enough. Want another beer?
  - So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
  - Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think
    is going to make it.
- - There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
  - Thanks for the speakers.
- - Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit
    to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how
    you felt...
  - Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
  - I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
  - I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
- - Ya love it, probie?
  - I'm in heaven, Lt.
  - Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
- - Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside
    me.
  - -- C'mon, Stephen.
  - -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think
    you and a hose were never introduced before.
- - Goddamn it Stephen!
  - -- I told you to stay next to me!
  - -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't
    know what I did!
  - What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
- - C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
  - -- Never mind.
- - Thanks.
  - Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
- - Hey.
  - Hey.
- - So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
  - Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody
    out, y'know?
- - Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
  - C'mon, let's crawl home.
- - Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
  - This?
  - Yeah... too bright...
- - Roll the hose.
  - What, are you kidding? By myself?
- - What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
  - You got a problem with drilling, probie?
  - No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill.
    Not one for the company and one for me.
  - Roll the hose.
- - Ready?
  - Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
  - Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
- - You okay?
  - I waited... I would have fucking waited...
  - That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And
    what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's
    dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
  - Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
  - You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What
    do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
- - Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
  - Thanks for the insight.
  - Brian, look --
  - Just leave me alone, okay?
- - '...Not now, Brian.'
  - Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there
    instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
  - I had that fire. He didn't listen!
  - He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't
    have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
  - Fuck you.
- - Hey, what are you doing here?
  - Just... Just wanted to say hello...
  - So hello.
- - Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming
    to look at this in a few minutes.
  - You're selling dad's boat?
  - Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of
    them...
  - I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
  - Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things
    you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what?
    It's okay.
  - Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
  - -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because
    I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what
    was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
- - It's okay, Stephen, I --
  - -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it,
    I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't
    have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go
    somewhere? Go...
- - I saw it.
  - Saw what?
  - When dad died, I saw another fire...
  - Everybody did.
  - I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for
    him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
  - '...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ''s sake,
    you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?'
  - I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to
    put that uniform on...
  - Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
  - Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
- - Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
  - I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
- - -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
  - -- What are you doing here?
  - I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's
    been killing people!
  - I know.
  - How do you know?
  - I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
  - -- What were they doing there?
  - They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
- - Anything else?
  - What are we going to do about this?
  - I'll handle it.
  - We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
  - I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
- - You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
  - Shut up!
- - You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
  - '"You never know till the fire stares you down if you''re gonna be --"'
  - Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
- - Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
  - I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
- - Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
  - My Lt. might have something to say about that.
  - Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the
    job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him
    into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
  - John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
- - Is he...
  - He's alive.
- - Did you do it for Tim?
  - That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking
    early? Why didn't you listen to me!
- - You gotta let me finish --
  - Just come down, John. Just --
  - -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
- - -- He killed people --
  - -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
  - -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
  - -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
- - Oh these moments do try me...
  - Be gentle.
- - Wash it to the windows?
  - No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
  - It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
  - Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high
    in the ceiling.
- - That's Franny. She likes firemen.
  - Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and
    hang some hose.
- - Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking
    quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're
    gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
  - No.  I need a drink.
- - You know Knowlton pretty well?
  - Yeah...
  - Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
- - Biggest in two battalions.
  - We're gonna be okay, man...
- - Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
  - It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
  - -- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't
    got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
  - Let me take the lead, Stephen...
  - Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
- - Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
  - -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
  - They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files...
    They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
- - -- Knock it off!
  - -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
- - '...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?'
  - There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
- - You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
  - Stevie... I...
- - How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
  - I don't know.
  - What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
  - Maybe I did... I don't remember.
  - I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
- - Can you believe how perfect it fits?
  - Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
- - You're late again, Rick.
  - I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
  - There can be no excuse for tardiness.
  - You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant.
    I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
- - Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me
    a call. I'm in the book.
  - Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
  - Right... Think it over.
- - You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
  - Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
  - True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
  - You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls
    every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
  - Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up.
    Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
- - That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
  - Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
- - Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's
    give him a break.
  - Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
- - Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
  - Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the
    deal with marriage? What can I expect?
  - Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little.
    By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers;
    by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season
    starts.
  - Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
- - Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to
    the party.
  - Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
- - Where'd she go?
  - She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for
    a drink... I have major news to announce.
- - Where the hell is he?
  - Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
- - What's the matter?
  - Nothing... Let's get crazy!
- - We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
  - Olivier's in that, right?
  - Then it's on to the real thing.
- - Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
  - This isn't right.
- - Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
  - Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
  - I'm not really hungry.
  - C'mon. I insist.
- - What the hell is that?
  - My gift to you.
  - Under the table!
  - The best table in the house.
- - I think you'll enjoy this table.
  - So long, Father.
- - I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
  - I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get
    off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
- - Rick, I'm concerned.
  - About what?
  - This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
  - Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
  - I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you.
    She loves to please.
  - Oooooo.
  - Right in there, pal.
  - If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
  - That's the old Rick!
- - How'd it go?
  - Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula,
    mister.
  - I'm proud of you, lad.
- - Who was that?
  - I don't know.
  - What's this?
  - Got me.
- - How 'bout this?
  - Still drawing a blank.
- - He look familiar?
  - Very.
  - C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
- - Now, don't get into any trouble.
  - Take care.
- - Hey, you guys...
  - Who's your friend?
- - How about this, a Trojan donkey.
  - And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness
    ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
- - What are you going to do about it?
  - What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
  - I'll stop him... You stall him.
- - Reach out and snort someone.
  - I'm saved. Let's party!
- - Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
  - Who?
  - Debbie.
  - My Debbie?
  - What's with her costume?
- - I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the
    other bedroom.
  - You got it.
- - How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
  - Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
  - Mrs.?
  - I'm separated.
  - Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
- - I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
  - Of course.
- - Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
  - No. Let's at least finish the set.
- - Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that
    lemonade?
  - In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better
    yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
- - The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
  - You can tell a man by his friends.
- - Ed... you're kinky!
  - The phone made me do it!
  - You've been having strange sex...!
  - No, Brett, I...
  - It's all right...  So have I.
- - Oops!
  - All right, who serves?
- - Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
  - Can't I just maim it a little?
- - Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting,
    a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
  - Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
  - I'd love that.
  - Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole.
    Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren
    are going to be little assholes.
  - Mr. Thomerson, I...
  - Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your
    marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If
    I may make some suggestions...
  - Feel free.
  - First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
- - Welcome, welcome, one and all.
  - Rick!
  - Oh, no!
- - The end.
  - No sob story is going to change my mind.
- - Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
  - Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
- - Are any of those right?
  - This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
  - Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
- - It's on the tenth floor.
  - What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
- - Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any
    funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in
    a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
  - I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
- - You're all under arrest. Open up!
  - Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
- - You want to share it?
  - Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
  - Right.
- - My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
  - Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
  - She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes.
    You sure you want to go through with it, man?
  - What do you mean, it changes?
- - Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
  - C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
  - I just want to be alone.
  - All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right
    after "Falcon Crest."
- - Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
  - No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah, I guess so.
  - Really?
  - Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
- - What the hell are you doing?
  - I'm trying to slash my wrists.
  - You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
  - I couldn't find any razor blades.
  - Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable.
    Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
  - Ha, ha, ha.
  - No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
- - Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
  - It's Bullwinkle.
- - It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
  - It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot
    of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now
    he's peaceful...
- - So, Larry, how have you been?
  - Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick.
    I love you guys. I love everybody.
- - I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
  - Larry, you and your wife got problems?
  - I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
- - Is that all the coke in the place?
  - That's it.
  - Good.
- - What can I be doing for you?
  - You're a pimp?
  - I'm telling you I am, Joe.
  - I want women.
  - That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
  - I'll take some.
  - Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
  - I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
  - You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate
    price for 45 minutes.
  - Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
  - Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
  - Milt?
- - Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for
    the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi,
    guys.
  - Gary, you're quite an animal.
  - Screw you...
- - Let's go.
  - Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
- - Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
  - All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys
    since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right
    from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the
    plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
- - Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
  - Because I love her. What can I tell you?
- - Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change
    a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play
    cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys...
    I always will.
  - Let's have a toast.
- - Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
  - What's going on?
- - It's true.
  - This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
  - Guy paints a beautiful picture.
  - I'm going to see what the hell happened.
  - Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
  - Screw that.
- - Hookers beat you up?
  - Yes.
  - I didn't know you were into that.
- - Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
  - Rick, I really think I'm in love.
  - This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from
    now on.
- - So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
  - Let's see your bread.
- - Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
  - They'll be up there in a half hour.
  - Okay. Nice to meet you both.
- - Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
  - What are you talking about, asshole?
  - Your whores never showed up.
  - They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
  - Screw you!
- - That's it, prick lips.
  - What are you...
  - I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
  - Why?
  - Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
- - This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you.
    But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
  - Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
- - Give him the works.
  - That's more like it.
- - Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little
    beauty pageant.
  - My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better
    call my service... tell them where I am.
- - Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
  - A real turd.
  - Well... hope she'll be very happy.
- - Great bathing suit.
  - I think I screwed that one once.
- - Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
  - Any time, Al.
- - I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
  - Great, Mom.
- - Why is Cole here?
  - You know your father enjoys his company.
- - A strange wang right in my palm.
  - Ilene, we don't really know that.
- - What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
  - Quiet, Mother.
- - I hope Ilene's all right.
  - I hope those guys are all right.
- - If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor
    party.
  - Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
  - Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience.
    What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
  - Ilene, Rick promised...
  - Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
- - Are you sure this is a good idea?
  - Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor
    party.
  - That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
  - Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
- - Let's go.
  - Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
  - Ilene, are you crazy?
  - I know what I'm doing... Go!
- - God, you're a slob.
  - But a fabulous cook.
  - What are we having?
  - It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
  - I think your dinner's burning.
- - Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
  - Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's
    really gonna be fun.
  - Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
  - You're going to have a bachelor party?
  - Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you
    think?
  - It looks awful.
  - Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
  - Are you going to have women at your party?
  - No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
  - I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
  - Oh, those. Why do you ask?
  - Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
- - Huh? Wha...
  - I can't sleep.
  - Oh... I got something for that.
- - Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
  - What's the matter?
  - I don't know... I just feel scared.
  - About what?
  - The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship,
    the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your
    bachelor party...
  - I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union.
    Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
  - Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
  - C'mere.
- - That feels so great.
  - Good...
  - Um... that's very relaxing.
  - Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
- - Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends
    and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
  - You better not have too much joy.
  - Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
  - Gonna get married...
- - This is it, lady. Last stop.
  - Can't I just go with you guys?
  - Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
- - Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
  - Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
  - You're really pissing me off.
- - Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
  - Your mother's not dead.
  - Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
- - Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
  - Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
  - I love you.
- - Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
  - How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
  - Why don't you get undressed.
- - I can't trust you!
  - C'mon, I knew it was you.
  - Rick, you're lying!
- - Let go of me!
  - Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
  - The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of
    your life.
  - I don't want that. I want to be with you.
  - And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
  - I am committed. I love you.
- - I don't believe you.
  - You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
- - See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in
    this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
  - Yes...
  - Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
  - Let's get naked.
  - You're on.
- - Are you okay?
  - Yeah.
  - This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our
    private parts a workout?
  - You're so romantic...
- - Cole?
  - Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
- - Cole, we've got to talk.
  - Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
  - No, Cole, I...
  - It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened.
    Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
  - Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
  - You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God
    wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
  - Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
  - You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
  - I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere
    else.
- - You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry,
    Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead.
    I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me,
    no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
  - Cole, I'm sorry, I...
  - That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
  - I'm going now, Cole.
  - I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
- - Hi, everybody. Am I late?
  - Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
- - So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
  - Sure have...
- - Nice shot.
  - Thank you, sir.
  - I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
  - Yes, sir, I am.
  - Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
  - I've tried to change her mind.
  - It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
  - But how can I do that?
  - If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take
    more persuasive action.
- - Thanks for the advise, sir.
  - Keep me informed.
- - So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop
    at nothing. You hear me?
  - What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
- - Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
  - Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
  - Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
  - Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now
    look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
- - Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
  - The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window
    so high up it was so scary I fell down...
  - Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
  - '1002.'
  - All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son.
    Go find yourself some clothes.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Hello?
  - Mr. Thomerson.
  - Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
  - Yes I did.
  - Fine. How's everything going?
  - Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I
    can't find it anywhere...
- - And...
  - Bond... James Bond.
- - Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
  - I want Debbie.
  - Cole...
  - You dump her and I'll give you cash.
  - What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
  - Five thousand dollars.
  - No.
- - Seventy-five hundred.
  - Not interested.
  - Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
  - I'm marrying Debbie.
  - Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
  - What is this person's story here?
- - Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
  - He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
  - Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
- - Rick, I want to talk to you.
  - Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
- - I don't want any trouble.
  - Oh, come on, just a little.
  - I'm ready to make you another deal.
  - Ooh, be still, my heart.
  - See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
- - Great car.
  - The best.
  - I love that car.
  - I'm very happy for you two.
- - I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
  - The car for Debbie?
  - I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
  - Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
- - Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
  - So does Debbie.
- - Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
  - Maybe it had something to do.
  - Shit!
- - Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
  - Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
  - You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
- - Cole, what the hell are you doing?
  - She's mine!
- - 'He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen
    movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!"
    Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.'
  - Fan out and look for them.
- - You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
  - Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
  - I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
  - What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
- - All right!
  - When do the girls get to the party?
- - Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
  - I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
- - Hey, you guys, what's going on?
  - We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
  - Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
- - I've decided not to run for President.
  - Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
- - Man, you're losing your audience.
  - Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
- - Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
  - Hey, man, congratulations!
- - I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
  - Rick's got an important announcement to make.
  - Yeah. What is it?
- - What?
  - You're kidding.
- - Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
  - Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
- - Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
  - Chulo, one thing at a time.
  - Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
- - I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few
    minutes.
  - Women!
- - Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
  - Bobbie, what are you talking about?
  - O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
- - He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
  - He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
  - No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't
    care... it's my decision.
- - What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
  - They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the
    dirty movies.
  - What do you mean?
  - I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of
    O'Neill's car.
  - You're kidding.
  - Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
- - That's what we're going to find out...
  - I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
- - Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
  - Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
- - What's happening?
  - Debbie's marrying Rick.
  - '...Really?'
- - Does Cole know about this?
  - Really -- you went with him for two years.
- - I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I
    showed you how to have oral sex.
  - Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
- - Look at that guy. What a hunk.
  - Check out the other guy's buns.
- - John Steed.
  - Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
  - The last one you'll ever see.
  - Perish the thought.
- - You're better than I expected.
  - I was at Harrow ...
  - But did they teach you this?
- - Bang-bang ... you're dead.
  - You wish.
- - One shot -- for emergencies.
  - That's not playing by the rules.
  - Rules are made to be broken.
  - If you say so.
  - I do.
- - You said ... one shot.
  - Did I? My mistake.
- - Aren't you forgetting about something?
  - You are, and it's behind you.
  - Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
- - I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
  - Ugh ...
- - Mrs. Peel -- ?
  - Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
  - No, please! I beg you ...
  - Walk over to the window ...
  - Let it be rain, please let it be --
  - Stay by the window. By the window.
- - Are you alright, young man?
  - I think so, thank you so much ...
- - Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
  - I feel sure of it.
  - I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
  - She was ...
- - You with Mother or Father?
  - Both, actually.
  - Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top
    job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
  - You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
- - Wonderland Weather Ltd.
  - This way ...
- - Mother. I thought you were burglars.
  - Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
- - Weather's turning nasty.
  - You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
  - Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
- - Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments
    could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded.
    We need your expertise.
  - Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
- - Think she really killed those agents?
  - She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
  - Amnesia?
  - Possibly. Split personality ...
  - Insane ... ?
  - Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
  - Why?
  - She may try to kill you.
- - Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.
    Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
  - How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
- - Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High
    stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
  - Anyone particular in mind?
  - You.
- - We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped
    them off ...
  - Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather.
    It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
  - Impossible.
- - This man -- did you see him?
  - No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware.
    Tell Father That's all.
- - You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
  - Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died,
    he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion.
    He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
- - Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
  - Guilty until proven innocent?
  - Mother and Father know best.
- - I was hoping you could tell me.
  - You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very
    nasty -- and so am I.
  - I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent
    and you have a mole.
  - Where?
  - In your operation.
  - 'I''m warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever''s behind all this, looks
    like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.'
- - A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
  - Global warming?
  - Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into
    African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
- - We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
  - So you say ...
- - Oh, hello ...
  - We want Mrs. Peel.
  - Dead, I'm afraid.
- - Steed
  - How did you guess?
  - You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
  - It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole
    who betrayed the Ministry.
- - Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand
    boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
  - Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can
    be overpowering ...
- - Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible.
    Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
  - I see.
  - Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made
    a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
- - 'Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.'
  - Peter's brother?  But --
  - Half-brother to be precise.
- - Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken
    by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
  - I know all this.
  - Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was
    under surveillance?
  - Surveillance? By whom?
  - Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
  - Who's now vanished.
  - Makes two of us.
  - Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together?
    But that's absurd.
- - I was getting to it.
  - Getting to what?
  - The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense
    initiative --
  - I fail to see --
- - Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
  - Well, I can't possibly go like this.
- - '''X'' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
    Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...'
  - '... and now?'
- - Privately owned by ...
  - 'Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.'
  - Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
  - I shall need a small plane.
  - You're not venturing alone, surely.
  - I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to
    Steed?
- - Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
  - I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
- - Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
  - You're saying I have no choice.
- - Where's Mother?
  - Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while
    he's hiding out ...
- - You don't believe him?
  - It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
- - Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll
    enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
  - Decontamination -- ?
  - And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're
    very beautiful.
- - Doctor Peel, I presume?
  - And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
- - I was about to throw in the towel.
  - I had a spot of bother at the door.
  - I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
  - 1922. Why the kippers?
  - Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
  - So what was all this -- some sort of test?
  - Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you
    weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
  - Whereas you are.
  - Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
  - Rules are made to be broken.
  - Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
  - And just what is the game?
  - I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
  - Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
  - Much better.
  - And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why
    you wished me to meet you?
  - I didn't. Mother did.
  - Mother?
- - '... Showers followed by sunny periods.'
  - We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
- - Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
  - A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
- - My father always wanted a boy.
  - Really?  I fail to see the connection.
  - I had a feeling you would. Touche!
- - Do you?
  - Yes indeed. I need protection.
- - I thought we were on our way.
  - Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half
    shod.
  - Or half cocked.
- - Steed, we really must be --
  - Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint.
    Or should I say DNA?
- - You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
  - Thank you, Trubshaw ...
- - That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
  - Do you really think so?
- - You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
  - Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
- - But why? What's the point?
  - A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as
    my suit of shining armor.
  - And I suppose you're the knight.
  - The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
  - That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
- - Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
  - As per mother's instructions.
  - Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
  - For a man in my position --
  - Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt
    like you get into this line of work?
  - They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
  - I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
  - After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
  - No thanks.
  - I meant me.
- - According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former
    head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
  - An eccentric recluse?
- - Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter
    somewhere -- Julie.
  - June, July ... August?
  - The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
  - Any other vices?
  - All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal
    Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered
    with by ... aliens.
- - So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
  - Small talk.  Try the weather.
- - Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
  - You should be dead.  How do you feel?
  - Strange.
  - You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away
    from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
  - I wasn't about to.
  - I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just
    overdressed.
  - I might say the same.
- - Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
  - Why should they think that?
  - You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for
    dead.
  - Frankly that's how I remember it.
  - But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
  - Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
  - That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met
    him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
  - Did he say who?
  - No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
- - An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
  - Did you say formal? I must dress.
- - I must say, you look more your old self --
  - You mean my other self ...
  - 'Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?'
  - I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
- - Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
  - How on earth can you tell?
- - Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his
    trade ...
  - Very good, Steed ...
- - What on earth?
  - Any ideas?
  - Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
  - Is that written in his shoe?
  - Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
  - She had this in her mouth. There, there...
- - For you, Mrs. Peel.
  - Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
- - But
  - Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
- - Not quite. This is my field.
  - Is there anything that isn't?
  - The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve
    the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible.
    We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite.
    A 'quick fix'...
  - Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
  - Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane
    gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer.
    But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
  - But if someone miniaturized the process...
  - That's what we were working on.
  - Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
- - Three agents killed by bad weather...
  - '... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...'
  - Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics
    obsessed by weather ...
  - '... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered
    twin?'
  - Not that I know of.  Explanation?
  - According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic
    delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading
    to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
- - Is that what you think?
  - Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
- - Do you always drive this fast?
  - Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's
    ...
- - What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
  - Barely.
  - You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't
    you?
- - This must be the last straw.
  - Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
  - Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
  - I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
- - Steed ... !
  - Mrs. Peel ... ?
- - Where am I?
  - The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel.
    Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
  - Was I?
  - I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
  - It was Peter -- I saw him ...
- - You followed me.
  - Orders.
  - To kill me?
  - Nothing personal.
- - I could save you the trouble.
  - No trouble.
  - Because you always obey orders ...
  - Always.  Except ...
- - Yes ... ?
  - '... when I don''t. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.'
- - And do you trust me?
  - I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
  - It wasn't me; you have my word.
- - Mmm ... what are you doing?
  - Keeping a stiff upper lip?
  - Is that all?
- - But you did suspect me.
  - Not for a moment.
  - You're playing games.
  - Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
  - I thought you played by the rules.
  - I thought you didn't.
  - I'm playing to win.
  - Winning isn't everything.
  - Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
  - After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
- - No, after you.
  - You don't trust me?
  - As far as you trust me.
- - I told Mother I took care of you.
  - You lied.
  - 'I equivocated. But you''re not their big worry at present. It''s Dr. Darling:  he''s
    disappeared ...'
- - Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
  - No idea who. No idea why ...
  - Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
  - '... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.'
  - Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
  - Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
- - Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd
    better be careful.
  - I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
- - His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
  - Why's he called 'Invisible'?
  - You'll find out.
- - Aren't you coming?
  - I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
- - We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
  - Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
  - You didn't tell her?
- - There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
  - Have we been invited?
- - What's that you're wearing?
  - It's called Black Leather.
  - Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
- - What is it?
  - Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
  - When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
  - You first.
  - Shall we?
- - Trubshaw again? What now?
  - Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
- - They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
  - '''The Merry Widow?'' I might have known. Where''s the reception?'
- - Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
  - Have a look at this.
- - I'll be back ...
  - Where are you going?
  - Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella
    ...
  - You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still
    the chief suspect.
  - No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
  - But --
  - Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
  - If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
- - Mrs. Peel?
  - What kept you?
  - The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
- - '''The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'''
  - '''... in a beautiful pea green boat...'''
  - A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
  - Still a bit chilly ...
  - English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve
    a long holiday ...
  - Have you any place in mind?
  - As a matter of fact I have ...
- - I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
  - It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
  - Our little paradise -- just made for two?
  - Not quite.
- - Our chaperon.
  - Pity your mother came, too ...
- - Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
  - Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
- - Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
  - Thanks, Valentine ...
- - You.
  - 'Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...'
- - A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately
    my research into plastics came in handy ...
  - Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
  - An unholy trinity ...
  - You killed my husband.
  - For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
  - Too many cooks --
  - Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything,
    even the Ministry recruiting you ...
  - But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
  - Of course. I planned that, too.
  - But -- why?
  - You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
  - '''Our revels now are ended.'''
  - Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
- - Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
  - I'm already married ...
  - Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll
    need a bridesmaid. Here.
- - You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
  - Valentine, listen to me ...
  - 'Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.'
  - Ring?
- - That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the
    way ...
  - You're mad.
  - Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
- - Such as?
  - Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into
    the air.
  - The result would be ...
  - Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn
    ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
  - Then what's stopping you?
  - One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information
    on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My
    dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip
    to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
- - The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter;
    I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With
    this ring my plan will be complete.
  - How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you
    couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
  - 'Speaking of Peter, there''s more good news: You won''t even have to change your
    last name. You''ll always be Mrs. Peel.'
  - What are my choices?
  - Choices?
  - I'll never marry you.
- - Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's
    coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
  - Hmmm ...
  - Looks like rain, Steed...
- - My number two. Special assignments. She's --
  - Let me guess -- 'Father'?
- - How curious ...
  - Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to
    find out.
- - Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
  - Ropes?
- - Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to
    smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
  - He tried to warn us ...
- - Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
  - Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
- - London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can
    control the weather, you control the world.
  - After the cold war ...
- - I resign.
  - You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
  - Watch me.
- - What are you trying to do to me?
  - We want to help...!
  - I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead.
    For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
  - The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
  - To you ... ?
- - Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special
    operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
  - The Institute ... the funding ...
  - A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
- - Who?
  - Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
- - This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are
    you going?
  - To find out who killed my husband.
  - The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
  - So am I.
- - About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
  - Next assignment?
- - Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
  - Thank you, Steed.
- - Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
  - Eh? In here!
- - Quite a collection.
  - If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects.
    Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive
    as the years pass.
- - Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
  - We have met ...
- - Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked
    us down. You are within an ace of winning.
  - This isn't a game.
  - Quite right, but we still make the rules.
  - Rules are made to be broken.
  - People, too.
  - Then who wins?
  - You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could
    that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
- - May I help you, madam ...
  - Mr. John Steed, please.
  - I'm afraid that's impossible.
  - Impossible?
- - You are female?
  - As you see.
  - Then you can't come in.
  - I have an appointment.
  - No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
  - Really -- what happened in 1922?
- - I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
  - You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket.
    Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
- - I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
  - Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no.
    The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely
    rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
- - You
  - Have we met?
  - You mean you don't recall??
- - Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
  - Promised? Who promised?
  - There, look!
- - Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ...
    The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ...
    come quickly!
  - Sir August...?  What now?
- - I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words.
    Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
  - '... bottle ...'
  - Red ...
  - '... head ...'
- - Knight ...
  - Black...
  - '... death ...'
  - Love...
  - '... death ...'
- - Flower ...
  - '... power ...'
- - Nature ...
  - '... preserve...'
  - Secret ...
  - '... love...'
  - Hope...
  - '... love ...'
  - Fear ...
  - '... love ...'
  - Peter ...
- - How long have I been here?
  - Three days.
- - He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge
    risk. The ultimate test.
  - So I'm still ...
- - Would that I could say the Same.
  - Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
- - We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
  - Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
  - Really?
  - Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside
    in June?
  - Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
  - Seriously?
  - Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline.
    For limited periods.
  - You don't say. How real does it feel?
  - As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
  - There are limits?
  - The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge
    demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
  - No need. I'll call again.
- - So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
  - Well, it's kind of weird.
  - We don't judge here.
  - OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially
    frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he
    wants me to take over the family business.
  - And how do you feel about that?
  - I don't wanna take over the family business.
- - What do you want to do, Scott?
  - I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals
    and stuff.
- - We don't label people here, Scott.
  - No, he's really evil.
  - Scott.
- - I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
  - OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't
    mean it.
- - Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
  - Great.
  - How's Austin?
  - He's asleep.
  - You didn't...
  - Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
- - I'm proud of you.
  - Why?
  - Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
- - Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't
    tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
  - You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times.
    In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
  - What about his teeth?
  - You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and
    still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
  - I just don't see it.
  - Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
  - Did you ever...
  - Of course not. I was married to your father.
  - Did you ever want to?
  - Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge
    of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men
    want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
- - You didn't answer my question, Mum.
  - 'I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever
    had.'
- - No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
  - I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
  - I love you, Vanessa.
- - We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates
    for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up
    in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment,
    there is some risk involved.
  - Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are
    the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant
    amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne,
    has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
- - Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are
    now divorced, actually.
  - People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw
    me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I
    had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which
    we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer
    around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely,
    ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless
    the world pays us a hefty ransom.
- - Umm, that also has already happened.
  - Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons
    and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway
    Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to
    the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we
    hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
- - Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars
    isn't that much money these days.
  - All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
- - Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
  - Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
- - Hi.
  - Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone,
    I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
  - I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship?
    I hate you!
- - But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
  - Not me.
- - An evil vet?
  - No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
  - An evil petting zoo?
  - You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is
    really evil.
- - Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
  - Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak
    English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling
    me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in
    Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make
    me'.
  - Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
  - Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
  - And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
  - Yeah. What?
- - Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
  - Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
  - In due time.
  - But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
  - I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving
    an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
  - Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him.
    Bang! Dead. Done.
  - One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
- - Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner.
    Close the tank.
  - Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
  - No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just
    assume it all went to plan.
  - I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains
    out.
  - No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
- - Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to
    begin. Scott, are you coming?
  - I don't want to.
  - Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
  - Blow me.
  - What did you say?
  - Show me.
- - Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
  - I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
  - I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
  - Scott, don't say that...
- - That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member.
    Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
  - Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
- - No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
  - Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey
    of a thousand miles begins with one step.
- - Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates
    have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
  - We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
  - The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
  - That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
- - Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't
    coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
  - Yes.
  - Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet
    your son.
  - My son?
  - Yes.  Scott!
- - Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
  - Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to
    defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
- - Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate
    Powers.
  - These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient,
    brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
- - Quite impressive.
  - Thank you, Herr Doctor.
  - I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of
    their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
- - Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads.
    I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
  - Dr. Evil?
  - Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
  - It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered
    Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red
    tape.
  - Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser
    beams attached to their heads.
- - What is it now?
  - Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they
    are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they
    sank to the bottom and died.
  - I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their
    heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we
    have?
  - Sea bass.
  - Right.
  - They're mutated sea bass.
  - Really? Are they ill-tempered?
  - Please allow me to demonstrate.
- - But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even
    though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm
    is only slightly older than the left.
  - Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
- - But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it
    for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as
    the other arm...
  - And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
- - We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
  - Silence!
- - Ahhhhhhhhh!
  - Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
- - We've got a lot of work to do.
  - Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
  - Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
  - Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
  - You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
- - Ow! You shot me!
  - Right. Okay. Moving on.
  - You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
- - Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with
    erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
  - Is it one of ours?
  - No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy,
    not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
  - What are you saying, son?
  - It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
- - Oh my God, he's back.
  - In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high
    quality meals at competitive prices.
  - Shut up.
  - Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
  - What's its current position?
- - Commander, I have to log it...
  - That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
- - Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
  - Sure.
- - Everything seems to be in order.
  - Hey, wait a minute--
- - Here, have a piece of gum.
  - Here, have a piece of gum.
- - Don't mind if I do.
  - Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
- - No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
  - No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
  - I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
- - Noooooooooooooo!
  - Where did you learn to shoot?
- - Danger Powers, personal effects.
  - Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
  - It says here, name Danger Powers.
  - Danger's my middle name.
  - 'OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat.
    One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed
    socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made
    penis enlarger pump.'
  - That's not mine.
  - One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
  - I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
  - One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
  - I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
  - 'One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My
    Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.'
- - Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed
    since 1967.
  - Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners
    without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs
    in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
  - My mother's told me all about you.
  - If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's
    witty. How's your mum?
  - My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
- - OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
  - Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and
    stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave
    immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting
    at Heathrow Airport.
  - My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
- - Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the
    Ministry of Defense?
  - I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing
    in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was
    accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on
    an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country.
    It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi.
    If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
  - That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
  - I beg your pardon?
  - I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are
    still working.
  - Excuse me?
  - My wedding tackle.
  - I'm sorry?
  - My meat and two veg.
  - Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very
    serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission
    and give your libido a rest.
  - Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
  - A Chigro?
  - You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
  - We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
  - That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses!
    Bring on the sexy stews!
- - 'Brrrr! She must be frigid. There''s two things I know about life: one, Americans
    will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They''re
    shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.'
  - Sure.
  - Do I make you horny?
  - What?
  - Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
  - I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
  - Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
  - I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps
    to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you
    were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of
    the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would
    not have sex with you.
- - You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
  - Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer,
    and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
- - Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives,
    and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
  - No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous
    advances in the field of dentistry.
  - Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
- - Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't
    mine.
  - I'm sure.
  - I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
- - I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
  - Here, use mine.
  - I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that
    we don't draw attention to ourselves.
- - I can't see a bloody thing.
  - Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad
    astigmatism.
- - Why did you leave so soon?
  - That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen,
    we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and
    see a man about a dog.
- - Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
  - Do you want to talk to him?
- - Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
  - Why?
  - We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
- - A limousine has just pulled up.
  - Let me see.
- - Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
  - How do you know?
  - I never forget a pussy... cat.
- - Let's go get him!
  - He's too well-protected right now.
  - We can't just sit here, Austin.
  - Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out
    some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run
    down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't
    we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
  - I don't get it.
  - Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
  - Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
  - No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
- - I hate having my picture taken.
  - You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
- - Fancy a nibble?
  - I couldn't have another bite.
- - Watch out, you're on my hair!
  - Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
  - Go! Just go!
- - I haven't had fun like that since college.
  - I'm sorry.
  - Why?
  - I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
- - Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
  - No, this is me in a nutshell.
- - You're smashed, Vanessa.
  - I am not.
  - Oh, yes you are.
  - I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
- - I can't. You're drunk.
  - It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What
    was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
  - She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other
    cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you
    Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
- - Really, Austin!
  - Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
- - Austin, may I have a word with you?
  - Of course, luv.
  - Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling
    about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid,
    but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.
    You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities,
    but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy.
    I'm sorry.
  - Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
  - I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
  - Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
  - No, did you use a condom?
  - Only sailors use condoms, man.
  - Not in the Nineties.
  - Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing
    to me.
  - Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've
    got to be a one-woman man.
  - It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
  - You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're
    going to be very lonely.
- - Hello, luv.
  - Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a
    female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating
    tapestry of human strum und drang.
  - Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that
    one coming.
  - Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
  - Out and about, doing odds and sods.
  - I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly
    professional.
- - Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece
    of gum?
  - Do you think she's prettier than I?
  - Who?
  - You know who.
  - No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
  - I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie
    inside her hootchie-kooch.
- - Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
  - Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India.
    I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously
    died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch
    me, now.
- - Thank God, Austin, we made it.
  - Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
- - Does that make you horny?
  - Not now, Austin.
- - First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next
    move. Any thoughts?
  - Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
- - All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the
    Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
  - No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
  - Smashing idea! Give it to me.
- - Not a good time to lose one's head.
  - Indeed.
  - That's not the way to get ahead in life.
  - Yes.
  - It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
  - Shut up.
  - Fair enough.
- - What do we do now?
  - We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get
    help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
  - I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
  - Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
  - I'll hurry back.
  - Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about
    shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't
    know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging
    her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN
    and OUT!--
  - Austin, what's your point?
  - Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man,
    well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
  - Oh, behave!
- - It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
  - Likewise.
  - I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they...
    and I...
  - I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
  - Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
- - Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
  - Are you crazy?
  - Don't worry!
- - Austin, I'm coming with you.
  - I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil
    Doctor.
  - I'll secure the perimeter.
- - I have something to tell you.
  - Lay it on me.
  - I love you, Austin.
  - That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
  - Kiss me.
  - Behave!
- - What's wrong with your hand?
  - Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at
    it, it's been rendered useless.
- - I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
  - Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm
    sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
- - Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
  - No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still
    going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin
    the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
- - I've got you, Dr. Evil!
  - Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British,
    and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're
    thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making
    a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things
    you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now,
    in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you
    care to admit.
  - No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you,
    whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known
    the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently,
    but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
  - Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever
    dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
  - That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we
    also have responsibility.
  - Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
- - It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
  - Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
  - Man, you are one chilly square!
- - Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent
    you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance
    is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
  - Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
  - Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
  - Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
  - That does not compute.
  - Why not? It's a question.
  - Love is... love is... love is...
- - Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
  - Hey, Mick!
  - Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
  - Well, you can't always get what you want.
  - '"You can''t always get what you want!" That''s a great title for a song! I''m
    gonna write that, and it''ll be a big hit.'
  - Good on ya, man.
  - Groovy!
- - Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're
    Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington.
    The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
  - We know all that, Exposition.
  - I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at
    any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is
    planning to take over the world.
  - Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
  - I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in
    Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic
    Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
- - Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
  - Good luck, Austin.
  - Thank you.
  - Oh, and Austin...
  - Yes?
  - Be careful.
  - Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
- - Where am I?
  - You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen
    for thirty years.
  - WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
  - The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
  - Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
  - You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments
    of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and
    General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
  - Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
  - A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
  - Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the
    people, hey Comrades?
  - We won, Austin.
  - Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
- - When do I begin?
  - Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
  - You mean Mrs. Kensington?
  - No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
- - Vanessa's one of our top agents.
  - My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell
    them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope
    I didn't say that out loud just now.
- - Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps,
    a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin,
    the world's depending on you.
  - Thank you, Exposition.
  - Oh, and Austin...
  - Yes?
  - Be careful.
  - Thanks.
- - Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's
    a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil.
    Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.
    That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
  - Thank you, Exposition.
  - Oh, and Austin...
  - Yes?
  - Be careful.
- - Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for
    confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon
    plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on
    that immediately.
  - Right away, Exposition.
  - Where is Vanessa, by the way?
- - She's working on another lead right now.
  - Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
  - Thank you, Basil.
  - Oh, and Austin...
  - Yes?
  - Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience
    flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
  - Oh, yes. Thank you.
  - There's one more thing, Austin.
  - Yes?
  - Be careful.
  - Thank you.
- - Hello, Exposition.
  - Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear
    warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion
    dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy
    the world.
  - Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
  - What's the other?
  - Excuse me?
  - What's the other thing you're scared of?
  - Carnies.
  - What?
  - Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
  - Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have
    a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
  - Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the
    details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
  - Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
- - My God, Austin, what have you done?
  - That's not your mother, that's a man!
- - I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
  - Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
  - You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks
    like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
- - All right, Austin, I think you should go.
  - I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like
    a man in drag.
  - I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
  - Yes, Basil?
  - Be careful.
  - Thanks.
- - Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean
    nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed
    from his evil lair.
  - I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
  - Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
- - Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
  - Austin, I have something for you as well.
- - Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after
    you.
  - Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
- - But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
  - Yes Basil?
  - Be careful!
- - Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
  - Hey, how are you?
  - Hungry.
  - Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
- - I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit
    for it.
  - If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
  - '"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I''m going to use that quote and not give you any
    credit for that, either.'
  - Smashing!
- - You seem surprised to see me.
  - I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
  - What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
  - What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
  - Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
  - You may.
  - Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
  - Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean
    construction division, yes. How did you know?
  - I didn't, baby, you just told me.
  - It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later.
    But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
  - Behave!
- - Come in.
  - I'd rather talk about Number Two.
  - Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you
    need to know.
- - May I wash you?
  - Groovy.
- - In Japan, men come first and women come second.
  - Or sometimes not at all.
  - Care for some saki?
  - Sak-i it to me!
- - How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
  - Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
- - '''Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up
    to say hello, and now it''s gone back down below.'''
  - That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
  - '''Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in
    the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'''
  - Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
  - To my health.
  - Kiss me.
- - Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
  - Is it about my teeth?
  - Yes.
  - Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
  - I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another
    poem.
  - 'I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: ''Press the button, pull
    the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'''
  - Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
- - What is it?
  - Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's
    idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
  - There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
  - Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
- - That kid's the great white hope.
  - I could get it out of him.
  - You're not listening.
- - Who're these guys?
  - Where is he?
  - We're too late. Take a look.
- - Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
  - Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the
    first place.
  - We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
- - We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
  - Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
  - There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult
    in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
- - Maybe he'll get back to work.
  - Speaking of which...
  - Yeah, yeah.
- - Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
  - Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the
    front door.
  - You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
- - So -- how far are we from the campus?
  - Oh we're not going to the campus.
- - So how'd you like the house?
  - His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
  - Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to
    micro-manage something.
- - Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction
    she's had to anybody.
  - She's a programmer?
  - Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be
    working with her.
  - I've got a girlfriend, remember?
  - Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties
    are married to Outpost.
- - What're they building?
  - '#21. Way behind schedule. It''s top- secret, but everybody knows it''s a digital
    broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.'
  - Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
  - You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say,
    this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
- - '...You got my E-mail?'
  - And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
  - Is that how Larry feels?
  - Uh. Not exactly.
- - Wanted to say goodbye to him...
  - Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
- - We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about
    work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100
    confidentiality forms.
  - Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about.
    Life stuff.
- - But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
  - What?!
- - They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
  - Jesus, Teddy.
  - I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what
    they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
  - I met this girl.
  - What? Come on. Is it serious?
  - I don't know.
  - Did you tell Alice?
  - No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been
    hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every
    day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
  - A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the
    chances?
  - What d'you mean?
  - I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
  - What does that mean?
  - Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
  - I didn't plan this.
- - Lisa.
  - You know my name.
  - You know mine.
  - You're famous around here.
  - I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
  - I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their
    teachers' pets.
  - '...Were you?'
  - We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
  - Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
  - '...Something like that. Yeah.'
  - Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this?
    We were -- escaping something.
- - Did I say something?
  - No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like
    computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like
    a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back
    and make it all work.
- - What've you got there?
  - Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
  - Show me.
- - Cool!
  - Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to
    --
- - Did you wanna be alone?
  - No. Please.
- - They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
  - '"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is
    it like that with your counselor?'
  - Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
  - Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
  - Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
  - You're compulsive.
  - Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
  - Why's that?
  - Long story. Not that interesting.
- - So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that
    then? Or now?
  - Then and now.  But not right now.
- - That's great. I -- didn't know.
  - She saved my life.
- - 'I snuck into #21.'
  - Why would you do a thing like --
  - You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening
    in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
  - The Day Care?
- - It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical
    files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever.
    But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
  - But why would they --?
  - You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable,
    they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business.
    They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
- - I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what
    he did to you.
  - Oh yeah?
- - Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
  - They'd frame him.
  - He's out of prison?
  - They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics
    an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
- - '...Milo?'
  - Hmm?
  - I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was
    unclean.
  - No, no. Never.
- - What about the FBI?
  - They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's
    over.
  - Who can we trust?
  - There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
- - Do we post it on the Net?
  - There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's
    horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
- - The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
  - Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful
    who we pick.
  - We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers.
    Not even at home.
  - Certainly not at my happy home.
- - 'He''s buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture
    libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.'
  - What about "60 Minutes."
  - Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information
    Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
  - But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
  - Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know
    he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
- - Time?
  - Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes
    out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins
    Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these
    places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can
    go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed.
    But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's
    got a finger in!
- - How close are you?
  - What?
  - He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network
    for Skywire. Let's use it.
- - We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch.
    I'd have to write in an aglet.
  - A what?
  - It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em,
    they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house.
    And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months
    away.
  - But they'd still get the idea, right?
  - You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio,
    too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
  - It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
  - Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
  - Before they kill somebody else, too.
  - Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
  - You mean -- break in?
  - I don't know --
  - And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place
    isn't finished.
- - Why were you so careless?
  - I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so
    literally?
- - Why were you snooping in my office?
  - Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
- - '''Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?'
  - '''Cause their apartments might be bugged?'
- - I told Teddy about you.
  - What'd he say?
  - '"A beautiful geek? What''re the chances?"'
- - I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting
    to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another
    person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody
    wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
  - Gary.
- - Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire
    we're there.
  - The dishes are juiced up, too.
  - Thank God.
  - 'Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was
    reviewing the card readouts.'
  - They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering
    into this on his own.
  - He doesn't know about the Day Care.
  - Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother
    with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to
    hide a leaf?
  - Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
  - Oh.
  - Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells
    them about it?
- - 'Same with the excerpts I''m choosing: they''ll play against any of the images
    you described.'
  - Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
  - You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
  - That's lame, isn't it?
  - You'll come up with something.
- - Does he know you know?
  - He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to
    me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But
    I've gotta go home for an hour.
  - Why?!
  - She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come
    home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
  - Please don't go.
  - At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
- - Meet me at the other location.
  - Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
- - They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
  - It's three years old, it --
  - Bring it to the other location.
  - But you said the other --
- - Maybe it's the satellite.
  - 'Let''s try #2.'
- - '...He knows.'
  - What?
  - 'He''s been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He''s a step ahead. Let''s
    jump to #12.'
- - Latitude 47 degrees.
  - Wait a second. He knows I know.
- - Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
  - Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there
    may have been a break-in?
  - Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God,
    it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna
    hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
- - Every entry was authorized.
  - Keep looking.
  - What're we looking for?
  - Any irregularity in the pattern.
- - 'Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.'
  - Let's get him in here.
- - Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo
    want in here, anyway?
  - They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first,
    ask questions later.
- - You calling Phil and Randy?
  - I'm calling Gary.
- - Come with me.
  - Where we going?
- - Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
  - I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected
    us to Gary's satellite.
- - All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
  - In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools
    after 'em.
- - I think you should go.
  - You do?
  - I mean, it's your life.
- - I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
  - 'You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can''t work anywhere else
    in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don''t miss you.'
  - Just thought his work should go on.
  - He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said
    "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
  - It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
  - Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
  - Those really weird, short lines.
- - Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
  - We'll come up with the next big thing.
  - '...You wanna work -- here?'
  - Got out of my other commitment.
- - You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
  - Cool.
- - This is good. Who did it?
  - '''Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid''s on Prozac.'
  - Maybe we should all get on it.
- - What'd the girl say?
  - There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
- - Hasn't affected his work, though.
  - Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
- - Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
  - Gary, don't worry, we --
  - Just do what I'm asking!
- - 'Okay, #2.'
  - Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
- - Ready for number three?
  - Let's go.
  - Longitude 109 --
  - Wait... He knows.
  - What?
  - '''Knows I''m altering the coordinates. Let''s jump to #12.'
  - Gary?
  - Just do it.
- - '...Hello?'
  - Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some
    amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
  - You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
- - Cool!
  - Would you like a Coke or something?
  - Oh. No thanks.
- - You know a lot about art, I guess.
  - There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
- - I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so
    far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star
    Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
  - Low enough to relay internet traffic.
  - 'Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the
    PC''s, TV''s, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can
    use the whole sky?'
  - Skywire.
- - The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the
    satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever
    new hardware emerges.
  - It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
  - You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working
    on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half
    the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies,
    phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would
    you like to ask me?
- - When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt
    you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
  - I do!
  - Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years.
    I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
- - No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
  - Okay. I'm Gary.
- - '''Think I should buy some originals?'
  - '...Do I?'
  - Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
  - That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
  - That's what I told her. My wife.
- - Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
  - Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's
    a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain
    sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
- - How's it going?
  - Maybe I'm going too fast.
  - Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems,
    Milo, they --
- - It's okay. Really.
  - Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
- - You did this -- overnight?
  - You're making me young again.
- - Milo. What's up?
  - Well -- you sent for me.
  - Right... Right.
- - You really wrote this just today?
  - What're you implying.
  - Nothing!
- - Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything
    strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get
    ahead?
  - I'm sure.
  - 'The purpose of this company isn''t to destroy our competitors any more than the
    purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you''re a
    zero or a one. Being obsessive isn''t a crime. It''s a character trait.'
- - It scales, don't you think?
  - Definitely.
- - I heard what happened.
  - Were the flags for Teddy?
- - Had you talked to him much lately?
  - Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work
    was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
  - Did you?
  - Talk about work? Never!
  - I meant did you find other stuff to --
  - Oh. Yeah.
  - You've been coming in early.
  - It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd
    do without her.
- - Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
  - 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
- - 'Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it''s
    in the wrong place.'
  - The wrong place?
  - The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
- - Gary, hi.
  - You look a little tired.
  - I'm okay. It's going well!
  - '''Have a look?'
  - Sure.
- - Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
  - '...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn''t think he was. That applied
    to guys who didn''t have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He
    could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a
    hole he dug himself, he''d give you the whole speech. And you''d better not point
    out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever.
    He''d wake us in the middle of the night. Off we''d go, again.'
  - What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good
    story, right?
- - No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to
    explain. Lying would've been worse.
  - '...Worse?'
  - Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise
    up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being
    savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now.
    Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
  - Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with
    the best of 'em I bet.
- - That's great! Thanks.
  - '''Sorry about the late notice...'
- - '"Dear Lisa. I''ve enjoyed working with you. I''d be lying if I didn''t say I
    find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party
    to send E-mail?'
  - I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
- - You could've handwritten it.
  - I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
  - Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
- - Gary, I --
  - You see what's hanging on the wall?
- - I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because
    of who you are.
  - I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But
    it's meant a lot more.
- - I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece
    of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
  - I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something
    breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've
    lost control.
- - Milo? I'm Danny.
  - Oh hi.
- - '''Couldn''t convince Teddy to come?'
  - He's pretty tight with his family.
  - We could move 'em up here.
  - He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition,
    everybody trying to own everything.
- - Who's that?
  - I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
- - That's gotta kill him, right?
  - Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns
    the Skywire satellites. Personally.
  - Outpost doesn't own em.
- - Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll
    pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
  - That'd change with a criminal indictment.
  - There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems
    to've vanished.
  - Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
  - Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
  - And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital
    Robin Hood.
  - Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
  - We tried!
  - You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
- - You're living here?
  - '''Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I''m writing programs for the
    local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show?
    God, does it suck.  Can you help me?'
  - Sure, I'll see what I can do.
- - Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
  - '''Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.'
- - This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
  - You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
  - Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
- - Will I get to work for Outpost?
  - No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring
    down Outpost.
  - What?
  - What'd they ever do for you?
- - Okay.
  - Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
  - What?!
  - Wanna be a part of history?
- - You're interfaced with our dish.
  - Gimme the coordinates?
- - Is it your software?
  - Is it your dish?
- - What?!
  - He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
- - '...When did you know?'
  - You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
- - Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
  - Right... What's that mean again?
  - Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs.
    Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need
    a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark,
    here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling
    it's the right thing to do.
  - It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
  - 'Like I said: shot in the dark.'
- - Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
  - '...It''s -- Milo, isn''t it?'
  - Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
  - Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
- - Milo?
  - Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
  - Have a seat.
- - What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
  - I am. I am, sir.
- - Milo?
  - My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
  - My goodness.
  - It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI
    gets involved with that. Don't they?
  - If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and
    DA do their work first.
  - I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
  - Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
  - '''Just didn''t know who else to talk to.'
  - And Outpost? You're happy there?
  - Yes sir.
- - '''Didn''t mention he was going to the Justice Department?'
  - No.
  - Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing
    your hold on him, are you?
  - He'll tell me when he gets home.
  - That'll be a test, won't it?
  - Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her.
    Or something.
  - Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on
    her. You keep yours on Milo.
  - Prick.
- - He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about
    great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency
    to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
  - He wasn't acting?
  - I don't think he knows how.
- - I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest,
    most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
  - C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three
    of four times.
- - A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it,
    and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
  - Then you've gotta ask him about that.
- - It's important.
  - If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
  - Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
- - When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time
    writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
  - But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
- - If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy
    he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
  - I think that's great, Milo. I do.
  - '...But?'
  - Didn't you visit the campus?
  - I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
  - No way. You have this -- destiny.
  - C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20.
    From eating --
  - Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
  - You saved my life in alot of ways.
- - When's Brian coming for the TV?
  - Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
- - That took some fun out of --
  - We're not gonna let it.
- - You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
  - Milo! What about --?
- - To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
  - That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
  - He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just
    today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
- - It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie.
    That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
  - What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
  - That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let
    him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
- - He's your boss. He's not your --
  - I know, I know.
  - If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
  - Isn't that -- extreme?
  - What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another
    sesame seed and that's it.
- - I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
  - You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
- - What!
  - Teddy was killed last night.
  - What're you -- what?
  - It was a hate crime.
- - Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said
    it was an airtight case.
  - I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
  - I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
  - I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from
    everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out
    of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
  - They hack into people's programs?
  - Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained.
    They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
- - It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's
    why they have the dishes on top.
  - You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
  - Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
  - '"Like this?" It''s Gary you''re talking about.'
  - You think I don't know that?
  - Milo. Why would he --
  - How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything.
    I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
  - Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with
    computers and --
  - It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they
    keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
  - Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope
    to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras
    and the swipe cards --
  - I can't just walk away!
  - You can't just walk in, either.
  - They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear
    by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
  - Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
- - I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
  - '...Whaddo I do?'
  - So you believe me?
- - It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
  - Nothing.
  - Nothing?
- - It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I
    just drove to Seattle and back.
  - '...Why?'
  - Remember Lyle Barton?
- - The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
  - I remember.
  - After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! --
    I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've
    been putting my own guilt on Gary.
  - Guilt?
  - If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
  - Poor baby. You know that's not true.
- - That was -- different.
  - '...Different?'
- - Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
  - Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To
    tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything
    from you...
- - Look at this.
  - What?
  - Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
  - He has thousands of employees, Milo --
  - It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
  - Milo --
  - I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're
    the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why
    should I be killing myself.
  - Milo, you --
- - Are you gonna tell me where you went?
  - I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
- - No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You
    know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
  - Just shut up?
- - Great!
  - Look at me! I'm gonna change.
- - You look beautiful.
  - Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
  - '...What?'
  - I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
- - Milo?
  - Don't we have any chopsticks?
  - Oh, right. Hold on.
- - Here we go.
  - Great.
- - '...wanna savor this.'
  - It's gonna get cold.
  - Right. Wait. A toast.
  - You're just afraid to eat it.
- - Is it over?
  - They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
  - You are a fanatic.
  - '''Gonna wait outside.'
- - Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
  - '"Make" him?'
  - You know what I mean.
- - I'm just screwed.
  - You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
  - You don't wanna move, do you?
  - I can paint anywhere.
- - I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
  - Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out?
    I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him
    like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
- - You think so?
  - You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
  - Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
- - How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
  - What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry,
    but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
  - I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
- - I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved
    in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
  - Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
- - Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
  - I've been great. And you?
- - How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
  - It's...it's...all right.
  - Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
  - Oh well, you know.
  - And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
  - Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
- - Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
  - Yeah, well, you're late.
  - Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the
    pork loin with lime jello.
  - We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
  - Nobody goes there anymore.
- - So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get
    it?
  - I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
- - And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
  - Cecelia is, well...you know
  - Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
  - Another Martini, Paul?
- - Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at
    the check.
  - Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place
    hr a nightcap?
  - No, man. I'm gonna bail.
  - Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue
    and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
- - You like Huey Lewis and the News?
  - They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste.
    But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially
    and artistically.
- - Hey, Halberstam?
  - Yes, Owen?
  - Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog?
    A chow or something?
  - No, Owen.
  - Is that a raincoat?
  - Yes, it is.
- - I'm so hungry.
  - It's cold out, too, isn't it?
  - I'm so hungry.
  - Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
  - I lost my job...
  - Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking.
    No, really-were you drinking on the job?
- - Gee, uh, that's too bad.
  - I'm so hungry.
- - Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
  - I'm not...
  - You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
  - I'm hungry
  - I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help
    you.
  - I'm hungry.
  - Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From
    people who do work?
  - What am I gonna do?
  - Listen, what's your name?
  - Al.
  - Speak up. Come on.
  - Al.
  - Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping
    you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
  - You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
  - Shhhh...it's okay.
  - Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
  - Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
  - I can't...I can't find a shelter
  - You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and
    stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
- - Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No
    don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
  - No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
  - Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging
    rumors... Spreading gossip.
- - Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
  - Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
  - I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers
    and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
- - So, what's the topic of discussion?
  - I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
  - You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
  - Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
  - Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
  - So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen.
    About yourself-
  - Coffee?
  - No. I'm okay.
  - Perrier? San Pellegrino?
  - No, I'm okay.
- - KIMBALL.
  - Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
  - Oh no, I'm okay.
  - It's no problem
- - Well, what's the topic of discussion?
  - The disappearance of Paul Owen.
  - Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not
    on "Page Six" at least.
  - I think his family wants this kept quiet.
  - Understandable.  Lime?
  - No, really. I'm okay.
  - You sure? I can always get you a lime.
- - Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
  - Shoot.
  - How old are you?
  - Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
  - Where did you go to school?
  - Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
  - Your address?
  - Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
  - Nice. Very nice.
  - Thanks.
- - Pardon me, but are you okay?
  - Who do you ask?
  - You seem...nervous.
- - Bad habit.
  - I know. I'm sorry.
- - Would you rather I not smoke?
  - No, I guess it's okay.
  - You sure?
  - No problem.
- - What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
  - Well...
- - How well did you know him?
  - I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
  - Yale thing?
- - Yeah...Yale thing.
  - What do you mean...Yale thing?
- - So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
  - He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
  - What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
  - I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
  - Do you feel that way?
  - No. Not really.
  - Where did Paul hang out?
  - Hang...out?
  - Yeah. You know...hang out.
  - Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The
    New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
  - He had a yacht?
  - No, he just hung out there.
  - And where did he go to school?
- - Don't you know this?
  - I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly,
    Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
- - Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
  - We were both seven in 1969.
  - So was I.
  - Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
  - Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
  - Well, maybe he did, huh?
  - His girlfriend doesn't think so.
  - But...has anyone seen him in London?
  - Actually, yes.
  - Hmmm.
  - Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says
    he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he
    mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
  - Oh.
  - Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
  - What?
  - I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like
    a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a
    young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano
    girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
  - Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
  - Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
- - Have you consulted a psychic?
  - No.
  - Had his apartment been burglarized?
  - No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some
    luggage. That's it.
  - I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
  - No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard
    anything.
  - That's so typical, isn't it?
  - It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and
    then...
  - Nothing.
  - People just...disappear.
  - The earth just opens up and swallows people.
  - Eerie. Really eerie.
- - You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons
    in twenty minutes.
  - Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
  - Uh, no. There's one...down here.
  - Oh really? I didn't know that.
- - Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
  - Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
  - Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
- - Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
  - Don.
  - So...you hang out here a lot?
  - Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
- - How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
  - 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
  - Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
  - Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves
    when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
- - I mean they want to get caught.
  - Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man.
    I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
- - I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
  - Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
  - Not really.
- - Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was
    on the twentieth of December?
  - God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
- - I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
  - Wait. That's not what I've got.
  - What?
  - That's not the information I've received.
  - Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
  - Let's see...  That you were with-
  - Well, I could he wrong.
  - Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
  - We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh
    riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No,
    Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't
    remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
- - Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
  - Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
  - Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've
    sorted out all this information?
  - Great, yes, I'd like that.
  - And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance,
    it would make my job a lot easier.
  - Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
- - Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
  - Not a big music fan, eh?
  - No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
  - Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
  - I'll be there.
- - No hash browns?
  - Not in the mood, I guess.
  - But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
  - Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
  - Suit yourself, I guess.
- - So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
  - I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
  - I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
  - But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
  - According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner
    with...Marcus Halberstam.
  - And?
  - I've questioned him.
  - Marcus?
  - Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
  - But Marcus denied it?
  - Yes.
  - Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
  - Yes.
- - He does? You're sure?
  - I checked it out. It's clean.
  - Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
  - Where was Marcus?
  - He wasn't with Paul Owen.
  - So who was he with?
  - He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George
    Butner and   - you.
- - Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I
    guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
  - Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe
    he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure
    he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed
    him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
- - What do you mean, she was a hot number.
  - If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl
    worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
- - She's my...cousin.
  - Uh huh?
  - She's from...France.
- - Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
  - He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
  - Don't tell him you're here.
  - Why would I?
- - This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway
    you'd like. I'm at-
  - You're at Paul Owen s.
  - Who?
  - Paul Owen.
  - I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later
    and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser
    on you.
- - Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too?
    Was he a friend of yours?
  - No.
  - Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
- - Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with
    that? It's totally disease-free.
  - Patrick, you re a lunatic.
  - Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
  - Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
  - Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
  - Does he do this all the time?
- - Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
  - No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
  - Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
  - Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
- - Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had
    four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps
    across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that
    it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
  - You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD?
    More than one?
- - Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
  - Hello
- - Well.
  - Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are
    the best.
  - Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people
    or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
- - Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's
    a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
  - Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
  - Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late.
    I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
- - Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
  - Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
  - Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall
    Street quite often.
  - Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
  - Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
  - Next Saturday?
  - Yeah.
  - Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go.
    I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
  - Okay. Do.
- - So, what do you do?
  - What do you think I do?
  - A model? An actor?
  - No. Flattering, but no.
  - Well...
  - I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
- - Welt...it depends, why?
  - Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like
    it.
- - Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
  - That's...that's too bad.
  - You think I'm dumb, don't you?
  - What?
  - You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
  - No. I really don't.
  - That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
- - Late?
  - Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
  - Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
  - I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
  - And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
  - When?
  - After six.
  - Negative. Cancel it.
- - Oh? And what should I say?
  - Just...say...no.
  - Just say no?
- - Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not
    there, try Crayons. All right?
  - Yes, sir.
- - Oh, something. . romantic?
  - No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
  - I'll do it.
  - No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
  - You look nice today.
- - Yes?
  - Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
  - Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
  - I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
- - You don't like this, I take it?
  - Come on, you're prettier than that.
  - Thanks, Patrick.
- - What is it?
  - Patrick?
  - Ye-es, Je-an?
  - Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
  - Who?
  - Detective Donald KIMBALL?
- - Tell him I'm at lunch.
  - Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
- - Patrick?
  - Can you bring Mr...
- - Yes, Patrick?
  - Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray
    as they sit in silence.
- - Jean?
  - Yes, Patrick?
  - Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
- - That is...if you're not doing anything.
  - Oh no. I have no plans.
  - Well, isn't this a coincidence.
- - Anywhere you want?
  - Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
  - Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
  - No, come on. Anywhere you want.
  - Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
  - Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us
    in anywhere.
- - Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
  - Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
  - Dorsia is...fine.
- - Yes? You're dressed...okay.
  - You didn't give them a name.
  - They know me.
- - Jean? Sorbet?
  - Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
- - Want a bite?
  - I'm on a diet. But thank you.
  - You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very
    fit.
  - You can always he thinner. Look...better.
  - Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
  - No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
- - And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
  - Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm
    at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm
    so... I don't know...unsure.
- - Do you have a boyfriend?
  - No, not really.
  - Interesting.
  - Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
  - Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a
    lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons
    - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
  - Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
  - Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but
    now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
  - Growing. I'm glad you said that.
- - Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard
    this?
  - Who's Ted Bundy?
  - Forget it.
  - What's that?
  - Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back
    to the cupboard for the nail gun.
  - Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
- - What...No! Put it in the carton.
  - Sorry.
  - Jean? What?
  - Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
- - I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship
    with someone special.
  - Hmmmm.
- - Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
  - I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable
    men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
- - If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You
    don't want to get hurt, do you?
  - No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
- - And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles
    Rust at '21.
  - Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
- - Patrick Bateman's office.
  - Jean? Hello? Jean?
  - Patrick? Is that you?
  - Hello? Jean, I need help!
  - Where are you?
  - Jean-I'm not-
  - Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price
    at Harry's for drinks.
  - Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
  - Patrick? I can't hear you.
  - What are I doing?
  - Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
  - I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
- - '...to the office this afternoon.'
  - Why?
  - Just...say...no!
  - What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
  - Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
- - Dorsia.
  - Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for
    two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
- - Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
  - Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
- - Dorsia, yes?
  - Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
- - We are totally booked.
  - Oh really? That's great.
  - I said we are totally booked.
  - Two at nine? Perfect.
  - There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
  - See you then.
- - Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
  - It looks that way, doesn't it?
- - That's Paul Owen.
  - That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
- - There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having
    sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's,
    muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you
    can get dyslexia from pussy-
  - I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
  - Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
- - Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
  - Maybe it's just the light.
  - Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
  - What?
  - It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
- - It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
  - I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
- - SHUT UP!
  - Calm down. Let's do it anyway
  - I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S
    OKAY!
- - Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry
    about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems
    at hand.
  - Like what?
  - Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop
    terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have
    to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter
    for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
    also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect
    the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
- - What's that, a gram?
  - New card. What do you think?
- - I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
  - But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
- - Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
  - Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
- - Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
  - Ask me a question.
- - I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
  - Leaving what?
  - This.
- - Don't, I'll drink it.
  - Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
  - Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
  - I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
  - Don't tell me...merchant banking?
  - No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
  - Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
- - And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
  - I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders
    for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
- - Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How
    on earth did you get a reservation there?
  - Lucky, I guess.
  - That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
  - Uh huh.
  - It looks so soft.
  - Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
- - Patrick? Is that you?
  - No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
  - This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where
    are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did
    you get your overnight bag?
  - Commes des Garcon.
- - Call me please, Patrick.
  - Jesus lives, Luis.
- - What...is...it?
  - Where are you going?
  - I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
  - Patrick?
  - What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
- - Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
  - Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
- - Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
  - Yes, naturally.
  - Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
- - It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
  - What exactly do you mean?
  - The message you left.
- - By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
  - But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
- - Carnes? Wait.
  - 'Davis. I''m not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on,
    man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman''s such a dork, such a boring, spineless
    lightweight, that I couldn''t fully appreciate it. I wasn''t fooled for a second.
    Now, if you''d said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let''s
    have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.'
  - What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
  - Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said
    he did to her?
- - Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
  - Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any
    of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's
    fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your
    machine was true.
  - Excuse me. I really must he going.
  - No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk
    to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
- - Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and
    I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
  - But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
  - It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
  - It's just not.
  - Why not, you stupid bastard?
- - Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
  - No, you...didn't?
  - Now, if you'll excuse me.
- - Are you my two o'clock?
  - No.
- - Can I help you?
  - I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
- - Doesn't he live here?
  - No, he doesn't.
  - Are you sure?
  - You saw the ad in the Times?
  - No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live
    here?
  - There was no ad in the Times.
- - I think you should go now.
  - But I think...I want to know what happened here.
  - Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
- - Don't come back.
  - I won't...don't worry.
- - You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar
    fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest
    asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking.
    We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good
    table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress
    .
  - What are the rules for a sweater vest?
- - Picked them up from the printers yesterday
  - Good coloring.
  - That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
- - Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
  - Nice.
- - But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
  - I know her. I knew her.
- - Because he dated her.
  - How did you guess?
  - Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
  - Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
- - Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
  - Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
  - No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
- - Listen, what about dinner?
  - Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
- - Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz.
    We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should
    do it.
  - Do...what.
  - Get married. Have a wedding.
  - Evelyn?
  - Yes, darling?
  - Is your Evian spiked?
  - We should do it.
  - No-I can't take the time off work.
  - Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
  - I don't want to talk about it.
  - Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
  - Because I...want...to...fit...in.
- - Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
  - Hi. Pat Bateman.
- - Why don t you just go for Price?
  - Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
  - He's rich.
  - Everybody's rich.
  - He's good-looking.
  - Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
  - He has a great body
  - Everybody has a great body now.
- - Are you using minoxidil?
  - No. I'm not. Why should I ?
  - Your hairline looks like it's receding.
  - It's not.
- - I want a firm commitment.
  - I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
- - Why? What's wrong?
  - My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected,
    but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
- - We need to talk.
  - Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
  - It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
  - Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue,
    alright? Now, are we having coffee?
  - I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we
    should see each other anymore.
  - But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it
    would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
  - I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have
    them.
- - You're really serious, aren't you?
  - Yes, I am.
  - But what about the past? Our past?
  - We never really shared one.
  - You're inhuman.
  - I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important
    to me.
- - No, no, no.
  - I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
- - If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right
    now.
  - Oh God, I can't believe this.
  - I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
- - Where are you going?
  - I'm just leaving.
  - But where?
  - I have to return some videotapes.
- - I haven't seen you around here.
  - You just haven't been looking.
  - Would you like to see my apartment?
- - Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
  - I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
  - Do you take American Express?
- - You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
  - Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly
    wasn't cheap.
- - I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
  - Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
  - I don't think so.
- - Nothing like last time, promise.
  - Alright.
- - So, you're looking great, how have you been?
  - Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
  - Really?
  - My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
  - Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
- - This is nicer than your other apartment.
  - It's not that nice.
- - Listen, what are you doing tonight?
  - What? Oh, I'm...busy.
  - Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't
    made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
  - Stop it. I'm...
  - On a lot of lithium?
  - Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult,
    Patrick.
  - You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
  - Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
  - Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
  - Pumpkin?
  - Yes?
  - Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
  - Uh huh.
  - Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
  - I know. Stop it.
  - Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
  - Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
  - Courtney? Dinner?
  - I can't.
  - I'm thinking Dorsia.
  - Dorsia's nice.
  - Nice?
  - You like it there, don't you?
  - The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone
    call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
  - Okay. Yeah. What time?
  - Eight?
  - Pick me up?
  - Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia,
    remember?
- - A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam
    where I bought this silver muffin dish.
  - Is that Donald Trump's car?
  - Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
  - You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some
    caffeine might get you out of this slump.
  - I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
- - J&B. Straight.
  - Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink
    back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
  - Are we here?
  - Yes.
  - This is Dorsia?
  - Yes, dear.
- - Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed
    squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll
    love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll
    follow nicely.
  - Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
- - Luis is a despicable twit.
  - Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
- - No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit.
    Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
  - Is it a what?
  - Pull out.
  - I'm ignoring you.
  - Pull out, goddamnit!
  - What do you want, Courtney?
- - It's a plain end. I think.
  - Turn the light on.
- - Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
  - Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
  - It's a plain end, see? So?
  - Take it off.
  - Why?
  - Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the
    ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
- - Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what?
    Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of
    the ejaculate!
  - Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want
    to get AIDS.
- - See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
  - Oh God, just get it over with.
- - Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
  - Maybe.
- - What are you doing tonight?
  - Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
  - That's nice.
  - You and...Luis?
  - We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
  - I never knew you smoked.
  - You never noticed.
- - Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
  - You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week,
    no Less.
  - Isn't that special?  Patrick?
  - Yes, Courtney?
- - Patrick?
  - Yes?
  - Nothing.
- - Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction
    back two months at least.
  - Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
- - You wouldn't have done that?
  - Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
  - I want them arrested and hanged!
  - Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting
    game here, Mr. Rains.
  - This is no game.
  - I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
- - '"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside
    St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered
    by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the
    West."'
  - It is a nice piece of writing.
  - '"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton
    Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able
    to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote
    this!? I''ll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!'
  - Oh, that's the best part.
- - It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how
    each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
  - I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these
    farmers!
  - Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men
    know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind
    them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were
    to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
  - So you can't tell me anything?
  - It's going to be a long winter.
- - Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not
    see men on the end of nooses.
  - All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite
    frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
- - 'First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you''ve given me a thousand miles of railroad
    to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to
    that area. But there''s just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves
    to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles
    between jobs.'
  - I can't believe this.
  - And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly,
    as heroes.
- - Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
  - I demand action.
  - No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results,
    you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool
    to saddle up and take another run at it?
  - Can't you tell me anything?
  - It's going to be a long spring.
- - So he's won.
  - No.
- - Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri.
    They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money
    to give family and friends.
  - In English, Pinkerton.
  - There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
  - Can you put men at all four?
  - No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
  - What is that?
  - Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
- - What the hell is that sound?
  - Vengeance.
- - Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
  - And it is my pleasure to be here.
  - Really!
  - NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken
    piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem
    to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may
    build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
  - I can completely understand your distress, sir.
- - Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston
    and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
  - Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
  - Good.
  - Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows.
    Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable
    Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
  - Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
  - Yes sir.
  - Just perfect.
  - A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from
    Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the
    farmers.
  - You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to
    be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
  - I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
  - I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of
    progress.
- - They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they
    raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
  - How much did they get from the safe?
  - Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of
    destroyed track --
  - I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
  - To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
  - THEN WHO DID?!
  - We did.
- - Your men knew the risks.
  - What is going on here, man?
- - With my money!
  - We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
- - The final route for the railroad is complete.
  - I look forward to seeing it.
- - Parker.
  - Sir?
  - What is that?
  - What, sir?
- - That.
  - Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
- - This is him.
  - I remember you.
- - How did you know?
  - Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
- - Well, this land is about to be condemned.
  - I'm doing you folks a favor --
- - Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very
    pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
  - It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street,
    so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower
    just in case.
- - My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of
    farm boys this time.
  - They had to be dealt with!
  - By burning down their homes?
- - How can that be?
  - They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers
    of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
- - There's only four of them...
  - Move you fools!
- - Why, yeah.
  - I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
  - Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
  - Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
- - Really?
  - I hope I'm not being too forward.
  - Not at all.
  - I just though you were awful cute.
  - Thank you, Miss -- ?
  - Lyla Devereux.
  - Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
  - Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
  - Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
  - That is so gentlemanly of you.
- - Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
  - Really?
  - Don't talk about it much, though.
- - And you're too young.
  - I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
  - And the same age Web was. No.
- - I like that.
  - No.
- - You okay, Jesse?
  - Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
  - Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
  - I guess so.
  - I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now
    it's my turn.
- - Jim, you been with a girl yet?
  - Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
- - Well, not exactly.
  - You been with a girl ever?
  - Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one
    of these paid ladies, you know?
  - I think so.
  - You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good
    looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby
    brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
  - I swear.
  - Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside
    and throw up.
  - You do that.
- - What about that Rock Island bastard?
  - It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want
    to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
- - '... too young for whisky...'
  - This time we'll make an exception.
  - Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
  - You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
- - This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
  - You don't think God'll mind, do you?
- - The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse
    James? The Jesse James?
  - I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want
    you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
  - Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
  - Thank you.
  - Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
- - Now let's have a drink.
  - Right here in church?
  - Communion.
- - We're moving you tomorrow.
  - But I like the presidential suite.
  - Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going
    to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
  - So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
  - That's the idea.
- - Did you order our houses burned down?
  - Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and
    Parker, that day.
- - You almost ended my career before it began.
  - Pity.
- - How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
  - Last February?
  - Mmm.
  - You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the
    cattle drive?
  - Yes?
  - The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
  - Damn.
- - Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
  - I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
  - No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
- - Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
  - I figured.
  - Was it worth it?
  - Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
  - That's what I would have done.
  - I'm not hanged yet.
  - You cocky little bastard.
  - Ahh, you'll miss me.
  - No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
- - That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
  - He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
- - The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the
    state of Tennessee.
  - Thanks.
  - I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my
    time.
  - Fair enough.
- - Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
  - You were little Jesse James when you left.
  - But you got big!
- - But still died.
  - If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
- - Jesse, are you awake?
  - Mmmm.
- - Jesse, is that your hand?
  - Nuh-huh ...
- - You shouldn't be up.
  - I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
  - You're sick of my company?
  - No! I mean, of course not. No.
  - Teasing you is completely unfair.
  - What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
  - I shouldn't tease a hero.
  - What?
  - Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud
    of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're
    everybody's hero.
  - I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
  - So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
  - Unfair. You are completely unfair.
- - I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be
    like when I got older.
  - You didn't want to farm?
  - I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
  - A river pirate.
  - Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
  - Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
  - Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
  - You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
  - Not if I find the right girl.
  - And what's this right girl like?
  - Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big
    buck teeth.
  - Where will you find such a girl?
  - Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
- - Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive,
    they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
  - Sparkling rocks?
  - Little ones.
  - Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
  - Yep.
  - Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
  - I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
- - I am so sorry, Jesse.
  - Frank and me have to go away for a while.
- - You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen
    if you do this.
  - Me neither.
  - Let the law --
  - Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
  - Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
  - When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
- - Zee.
  - Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this
    county!
  - I had to see you. I'm getting married.
- - I don't understand.
  - She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
  - That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
  - She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
- - I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
  - That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
  - Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
  - I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked
    in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a
    long time.
  - Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the
    wedding.
- - Hmm.
  - '"Hmm" what?'
  - '"But the life of the James Gang wasn''t all robbing and shooting and killing,
    for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome
    and charismatic Jesse James."'
- - I beg your pardon?
  - '"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel
    lobby.'
  - Let me see that.
  - Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and
    his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied
    apple."  As I said. Hmm.
  - Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would
    you?
  - Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of
    trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
  - Aw, shucks, ma'am...
  - Stop it. This is just sad.
  - Swimming. Swimming is good.
- - Don't turn around.
  - What?
  - If you don't see it, it's not real...
- - You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
  - Yes ma'am.
  - I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
  - You are a hell of a woman.
  - Don't swear.
  - Yes ma'am.
- - Tennessee?
  - I'll explain on the way.
- - Did you kill Yankees?
  - A fair number, Ma.
  - Say your prayers?
- - Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
  - He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all
    right boy.
- - Easterners.
  - We're just fine, thank you, sir.
- - The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
  - Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
- - Ma! Please!
  - Boys?
- - Riders --
  - We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
  - Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
- - Doc Mimms will --
  - Shush.
- - Y'know, Uncle Frank...
  - Yeah, Jimmy?
  - '...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That''s not how it ended.
    I was five when my dad got shot.'
  - I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into
    a new life, growing old together, happy.
- - Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough
    painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
  - Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
  - That he was.
  - They're making him a hero now.
  - Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
  - But he killed a lot of men, too.
  - Can't argue that.
  - So what was he?
  - I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
- - Uncle Frank?
  - Yeah Jimmy?
  - How much of that story is true?
  - Everything but the boring parts.
- - Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
  - So we got a plan?
- - Distracting enough for you?
  - Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
  - So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
  - Mm-hmm.
  - Such as?
  - You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
  - That would have made an impression.
  - I figure.
  - See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm
    already finished doing it.
  - No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring
    it out.
- - Web's dead.
  - I reckoned.
  - Hell of a war.
  - I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
- - Hello, Liberty Missoura!
  - All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn
    horse just on principle.
- - Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
  - We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
- - Frank, don't you have something to say?
  - You're doing just fine.
  - Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
- - Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
  - Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not
    for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
- - All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get
    me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by
    me.
  - Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be
    all right.
  - What kind of story are they going to believe?
- - That just might work.
  - Maybe, maybe...
- - '"Big and older"?'
  - You can shut up now.
  - You are a charmer.
  - I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
  - Next time try "fat and haggard."
- - She's still talking to Jesus.
  - What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
- - -- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
  - 'Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women''s eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still
    the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show,
    contain, and nourish all the world."'
- - You know him?
  - Heard of him.
- - I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail
    bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on
    both sides for as far as they can.
  - Damn. All that reading paid off.
- - You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
  - What do you think?
  - Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you
    herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
- - You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
  - Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
- - Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
  - Ma.
- - '... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.'
  - Don't care.
  - Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
  - Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
- - How'd it go in there?
  - Fine. How'd it go out here?
  - We're gonna have to talk...
- - And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
  - And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together,
    right?
- - And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
  - And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
- - I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real
    bills to compare?
  - It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
- - Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
  - Bob's upset.
  - The posters?
- - Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
  - Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
- - This has been a good year.
  - Jesse, we're outlaws.
  - And we're good at it.
  - It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
  - You've killed your fair share of men.
  - If I could go back to farming --
  - That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
  - I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted
    it that way.
  - We're doing this for Ma.
  - Maybe it started out that way. But now...
  - What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like
    getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a
    helluva better life than farming.
  - A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
- - We're drunk.
  - Oh yeah.
  - Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
- - You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
  - No, I --
- - They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
  - Got any ideas, little brother?
- - Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got
    Web killed. Now Jim.
  - Jim was old enough...
  - He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed
    to say no to that?
  - Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
  - You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
  - Yeah.
  - A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
  - I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
- - I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
  - See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
  - Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
- - Daddy, don't start with this again.
  - Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up
    land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
- - He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
  - The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't
    hurt.
- - They're gone. What are you --
  - I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
  - Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
  - I think he's already feeling better.
- - He thinks this is some kind of game!
  - I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they
    won't press their luck.
- - -- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
  - My little Web did that?
  - Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before
    they knew what hit them.
- - Web died fighting?
  - Died a hero.
- - Boys...
  - Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
- - What do you say, sir?
  - Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
- - You know you're welcome any time!
  - Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place
    near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
  - It's fine by me, Jesse.
- - What the --
  - What is it?
  - Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
  - So?
  - When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
- - Where the hell were you?
  - I had you covered.  From back there.
  - Shit.
- - I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
  - You're right, sir.
  - Then why can't I go in there?
  - On account of we're robbing it.
  - Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
  - It's a secret.
  - Fine. I'll just wait here.
  - I'd appreciate that.
- - You 'um big lawman?
  - Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
  - Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
  - The District Marshall
- - Of St. Louis?
  - Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward
    Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
  - East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
  - Ho-yah!
- - Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
  - Me get heap firewater --
- - The safe. Now.
  - Of course!  Uh, sir?
  - What?
  - Where is Jesse James?
  - This here is the Younger Gang!
- - OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
  - All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
- - Cannon or Gatling?
  - Both would be nice.
  - Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
- - What the --
  - Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
- - I think one of 'em's glass.
  - Which one, right or left?
  - The brown one.
- - Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
  - Sadie was not a man!
- - I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
  - Shakespeare.  He's European.
  - Ah.
- - BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
  - Get buckets!
- - Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this
    idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying
    about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to
    think --
  - Strategically.
  - -- Exactly. Because this is a war.
- - Jesse.
  - Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger
    where and when to ride?
  - Cole, he didn't mean that.
- - Another dozen out back.
  - They gonna rush us?
  - They're just insurance in case we run.
- - Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
  - You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
- - Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse
    James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
  - You ride like a Comanche.
- - Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation?
    Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
  - Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
  - Well?
  - I'm thinking...
- - '''Bout time you got here, buddy.'
  - What's going on?
- - Ride with me, cousin?
  - I could use the walk.
  - Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride,
    Rangers!
- - Where you boys going?
  - There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
- - Home, boys. Back to our farms.
  - Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
- - Hands off your hip, Cole.
  - You're not scared, are you?
  - Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
- - Not now.
  - What is wrong with you?
  - In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
- - You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
  - She got two of them.
- - She had a moustache.
  - She was European!
  - All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
- - Thanks for the help.
  - After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
  - The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
  - It was exciting.
  - But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
- - Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone
    I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you
    are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
  - Yeah.
- - This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives,
    they can replace 'em in a day.
  - So what do we do, General Lee?
  - Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they
    won't care.
- - I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she
    can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
  - Perfect, Cole.
  - Let's ride.
- - The James-Younger Gang.
  - Sorry.
  - Don't let it happen again.
- - I got seven thousand.
  - I got three.
- - See, Frank's being smart about this.
  - Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make
    him smart.
- - It's not a bank.
  - It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo
    and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
- - '"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily
    armed men."'
  - Twenty?!
- - Jesse, we got to have a word.
  - Sure, cousin.
  - All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
  - Yep.
  - Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers
    and only two James brothers here.
- - This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
  - Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
- - It'll be the biggest score yet.
  - What will be?
- - Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
  - If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
  - What are you saying?
  - I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this
    bank, and I say it's an easy job.
  - You're forgetting who's in charge --
- - Beautiful.
  - Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
  - A bad idea.
  - I got us through the War all right.
  - And almost got hanged in peacetime.
  - That's it.
- - I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
  - And I'm the better outlaw.
- - Still smells fishy.
  - Then let me run the show, General Lee.
- - Fine. We hit this bank.
  - You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's
    going to make everybody rich!
- - Dammit!
  - A trap.
- - Okay, you're gonna rest here.
  - Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
- - Bob, rip up some bandages.
  - Pass me some whisky.
- - We'll make them pay for this.
  - I'm out.
  - WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're
    gonna quit?!
  - Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
- - Missed you, cousin.
  - Missed you too, cousin.
- - You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
  - Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
- - Where'd you get all these riders?
  - We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
- - What?
  - You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
- - What you sayin' boy?
  - I think I recognize you.
  - How?
  - I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
- - You shut up now, boy.
  - No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you
    couldn't find your --
- - Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone
    that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God
    help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
  - Best damn plan I heard all war.
- - How many of them did he kill?
  - Two.
- - You have no shame.
  - Not yet. But I'm hoping.
- - But if we take their money and supplies...
  - Exactly.
- - All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
  - Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble
    of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
  - We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people
    hurting up there.
- - '"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of
    town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."'
  - Hey!
  - '"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."'
- - Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
  - One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
- - Beg pardon?
  - You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
- - This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
  - Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
- - The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
  - You are a fine figure of a man.
  - Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
  - He's been full of vinegar lately.
  - He's planning a job.
  - What?
  - Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
  - Tell me.
- - My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
  - I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
- - Yesterday.
  - Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
- - Corn gonna shoot at me?
  - Nope.
  - Then I love it.
- - Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
  - '... Will Perry ...'
- - Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
  - Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
- - They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim
    tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him
    out. Cole lost his temper.
  - Oh no...
  - He just lost his temper a little.
- - Damn!
  - They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior
    --
  - The Army can hang him.
  - Tomorrow.
- - Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
  - Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
- - He's smiling.
  - Never a good thing.
- - Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
  - Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
- - Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
  - That was two hours ago.
- - Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
  - Zee, I'm pleased you came.
- - Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
  - The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
  - I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
- - These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
  - Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
- - Uhh, yeah it does.
  - You stay out of this, Bob.
- - No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
  - How?
  - Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna
    be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we
    never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out
    instead of raising their arms.
- - We got a problem here, brother?
  - Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
- - That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be
    able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
  - What?
- - This is the best score yet.
  - It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
  - That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
  - As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we
    deserve.
  - Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I
    mean.
  - Leave me alone, Bob.
- - How'd they --
  - What have you done?
  - I ain't done --
  - WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
- - Bob. I didn't...
  - Swear.
  - I swear --
  - Swear on Jimmy's grave.
- - I'm sorry, Cole.
  - You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
- - Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's
    ride."
  - He's not bad at it.
  - It's tougher than it looks.
- - You can ride like that?
  - I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
- - I think I may just go on to the reservation.
  - Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
- - I couldn't lose him.
  - Jim Younger, I told you--
- - This is healing?
  - Sometimes a wound will kill.
  - Now you tell us.
- - You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
  - Okay, Matt.
- - How are you fixed?
  - I'm okay, Matt.
  - You've got enough?
- - That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
  - Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
  - Bought himself a pocketbook!
- - Everybody in?
  - I guess so.
  - Where's Charlie?
  - Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find
    it.
- - Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
  - They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any
    time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right
    away. Step on it.
- - You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve
    and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
  - wasn't anywhere near this place
  - Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the
    gun?
  - I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
  - You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
- - Then who changed it?
  - I don't know.
- - So you were home last night?
  - Yes.
  - What time did you get in?
  - Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
  - Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
  - Yes.
- - But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
  - Then where were you?
- - Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
  - Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
- - for the rheumatism, you know.
  - What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
  - It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you
    know.
- - What time was it?
  - Huh?
  - What time did Matt Brown get in?
  - Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters
    never get home until after
  - I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
  - That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley
    sisters . . .
  - Was it twelve o'clock?
- - Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
  - It couldn't have been earlier?
  - No. It wasn't earlier because...
  - Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
  - No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
  - There you are!
- - Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
  - That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
- - What did you find out, Mike?
  - I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy,
    chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
  - Never mind all that. What did you find out?
  - He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
  - Dude Finlay?
  - Yes, sir.
- - Did you say Dude Finlay?
  - Yes, why?
  - He was in the bank yesterday.
  - He was here?
  - He came to see Mr. Cluett.
  - Are you sure?
  - Yes, sir.
- - Hello, Helen!
  - Matt, come here!
  - Why?
  - Come here, honey!
- - Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
  - Oh, is that so?
- - What did you do with it?
  - With what?
  - The ten dollars.
  - Oh, ten dollars
  - Yes.
  - A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying,
    would you believe it?
- - No.
  - Oh, you think I'm lying?
  - Yes.
  - All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
  - Oh, Matt.
- - Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
  - Yeah, swell.
- - What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
  - Yeah.
- - What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
  - Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson
    was there.
  - Well . . . ?
  - Well, he was making love to her.
- - Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
  - I tell you, I saw them!
- - In Cluett's office?
  - Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
- - What's keeping you?
  - Oh, Charlie again.
  - Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
  - Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked,
    horse dollar.[6]
  - Oh now, don't be silly.
  - Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
  - Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
  - Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
- - Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
  - All right, dear.
- - Oh, Matt . . .
  - Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
- - What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
  - Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
  - They must have turned him down.
  - Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
  - Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk
    to him.
- - Did you talk to him?
  - Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
- - Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
  - Mr. Williams . . .
  - The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr.
    Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him,
    who is going to help him?
  - Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
- - How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
  - Is that busy husband of mine busy?
  - He's at a board meeting.
  - Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
  - I'm afraid so.
  - Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
  - No.
  - Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other
    woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out
    now, can you?
  - Hardly.
- - Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself
    a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't
    gotten rid of me!
  - All right.
- - Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
  - Is it safe?
  - Absolutely.
  - It's his life insurance money, you know.
- - Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
  - But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll
    go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
  - Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks.
    All right, folks, please!
- - Well, Sampson, what is it?
  - Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
- - Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick
    and tired of the delay.
  - I'm afraid he's been stalling.
  - That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed
    weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
  - He says he can't get away in the daytime.
  - How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow
    night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
  - Yes, sir.
- - The lobby's half filled now.
  - What are you talking about?
- - They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
  - All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right
    away.
  - We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have
    to close the doors.
- - The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry,
    that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get
    a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute.
    Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone
    caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
  - Did you get the case for the securities?
  - Yes, sir.
  - Mine too?
  - Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
- - The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody
    starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
  - What'll we do?
  - I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible.
    Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
- - We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
  - Don't you think I know it?
- - Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
  - Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing
    but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their
    time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
  - Yes, sir.
  - I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know
    where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing
    yet.
- - What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this
    boy on a vague suspicion.
  - I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
  - Why pick on him ?
  - It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of
    the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
  - Yes.
- - What time did this thing happen?
  - The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
  - All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
  - If he can do it, yes.
  - Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you
    were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all
    right.
- - That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
  - Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll
    be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
- - All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I
    see it, Brown here looks guilty.
  - What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
  - Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
  - So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that
    make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
- - Of course it's true - and he knows it.
  - Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last
    night?
- - You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's
    your man.
  - Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
  - He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
- - My wife? What's she got to do with you?
  - No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
- - You're lying!
  - Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll
    have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
  - You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
- - It's all right. Thanks.
  - And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the
    fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
- - What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
  - Sure, I think it's swell.
  - Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something?
    Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
- - Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited.
    I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll
    never be able to thank you enough.
  - Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot
    of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been
    to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
  - Well, I
  - I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
- - I already told him I was home.
  - There you are.
- - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something?
    You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't
    do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where
    were you last night?
  - I can't tell you.
- - No. I won't.
  - You're protecting somebody.
  - No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
  - Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference
    who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were
    you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
- - We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or
    it'll be too late.
  - Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
  - You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
  - Were you in Cluett's apartment?
  - Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize
    what that means?
  - Was Mrs. Dickson there?
  - Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots
    turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys
    - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do
    is
  - Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
  - Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
  - She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
  - Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your
    bank and
  - All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
- - I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married
    right away!
  - But I haven't . . .
  - I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both
    of you.
- - Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the
    bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
  - Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
- - Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
  - I haven't any.
  - You haven't got a uniform?
  - No, sir.
  - My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
  - Why, I don't know.
  - You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
- - Oh, make that uniform blue.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
  - Yes, sir.
  - Looks good. How much did it cost?
  - I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
- - Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
  - Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
  - Got my letter?
  - Yes, thank you.
  - Hello, Helen.
- - Mr. Dickson?
  - Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take
    care of that mortgage for you . . .
- - But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only
    want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
  - Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty
    . . .
- - Yes?
  - Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the
    arrangements, will you?
  - Yes, sir.
- - Yes?
  - Mr. Sampson . . .
  - All right. Send him in.
- - Helen!
  - Yes?
  - Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
- - Good morning.
  - Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about
    it?
  - I don't know.
  - Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get
    married?
  - Why - well, I
  - Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
  - Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
  - Directors, eh? Long faces?
- - Longer.
  - I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
- - Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
  - Where is he now?
  - In Mr. Sampson's office.
  - Now don't you worry about it.
- - Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some
    action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man
    Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
  - Yes, sir.
- - You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
  - Numbers? No, never mind.
- - Good morning, Helen.
  - Good morning.
  - Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
- - Oh!
  - Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I
    are going to go on the honeymoon.
- - Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
  - Hello, darling.
- - If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of
    Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete
    the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man,
    what a man!
  - It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
  - Oooh! That has the earmarks!
- - What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
  - Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
  - Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
  - Yes.
  - I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
- - Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to
    it.
  - But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
  - I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me,
    and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the
    whole thing.
  - Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
  - The theatre?
  - That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
  - Yes, of course.
  - You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
  - The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find
    myself an attractive young man . . .
- - Ho! Ho! Ho!
  - Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it,
    but I'm still attractive - to some.
  - Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
  - Well . . .
  - Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the
    tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
  - Tomorrow night?
- - All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
  - Happy now?
  - No.
- - Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to
    ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
  - Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
  - Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
  - In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
- - Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
  - John, how's your wife this morning?
  - Much better this morning, thank you.
  - Got a handkerchief?
- - Excuse me
  - Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
  - I'm feeling fine this morning.
  - That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
  - Thank you!
- - Shall we let the people come in?
  - Of course, let them in! You're late now.
- - Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
  - Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
- - Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
  - Yes, sir.
  - Let me see your cash book, will you?
  - Now?
  - Yes, now.
- - The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
  - Oh, yeah?
- - Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
  - I'm listening.
  - It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see,
    I kind of expected to find you here alone.
- - Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
  - Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about
    you and Mrs. Dickson.
- - I'm not interested in what you think.
  - You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's
    only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
  - I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
  - No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you.
    Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
- - Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
  - This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever
    done to you to deserve a deal like this?
  - That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
  - I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
- - This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
  - Why, I needed a
- - What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
  - Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's
    you . . .
  - Me?
  - Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
  - For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that
    any female could do this to you .
  - Well, you can. You always could.
  - Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
- - Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired
    of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
  - What is?
  - running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
  - If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
  - Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about
    your line.
  - Line?
  - Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
- - Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class
    blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
  - But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
  - Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight,
    Phyllis?
- - Doesn't that come next?
  - Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
  - See, we're getting along famously!
- - Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations,
    Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order.
    I shall recommend you highly.
  - Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
- - But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells,
    whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning
    it for months.
  - Well
  - Well, what?
  - Well, aren't you going to invite me?
  - You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
  - Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
  - Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you
    to death.
  - No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
  - Why are you so anxious?
  - Don't you know?
  - No.
  - I want to be near you!
- - What?
  - Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
  - Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
  - I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
  - Why, Cyril, you're insane
  - No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of
    myself. But I won't stand it any longer
  - Cyril!
- - What's this?
  - My apartment.
  - I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
  - Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
  - No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
  - What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
  - No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off
    to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings.
    Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
  - Good for you. Come on.
- - You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's
    comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
  - Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood
    wife.
  - What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
  - A misunderstood bachelor.
- - And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
  - I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
  - I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
- - Why, Matt!
  - What are you doing here?
- - You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
  - I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
  - That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
  - I haven't got it.
- - Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's,
    you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
  - I'm sorry, Dude, butI
  - That don't do us any good.
  - But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
  - We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
- - Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
  - Why not?
  - Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
  - You don't have to do nothing.
- - What do you mean?
  - All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
- - Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
  - You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
  - know, but
  - Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
  - But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
  - Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
- - Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
  - I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
  - What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of
    people?
  - Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
  - Fifty thousand dollars!
  - But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
- - What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
  - Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what
    I'm saying.
  - You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your
    apartment?
  - She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
- - She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged
    her to come up. She didn't
  - Get out, get out!
- - I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
  - Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
  - Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
  - That's very simple. I was home.
- - That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
  - Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
  - Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr.
    Cluett?
  - If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes
    absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
  - Oh!
  - You understand?
  - Why, of course.
- - Thanks.
  - Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
  - It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever
    he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
- - Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
  - All right, Jack, all right.
- - Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
  - Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
- - What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
  - They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
- - I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered
    around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . .
    .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will
    you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
  - Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
  - I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my
    apartment last night - I can prove it!
  - Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
  - He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in
    my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
- - Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've
    got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you
    can hit anything
  - I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time
    here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
  - Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's
    on your mind?
- - What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last
    twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind
    of banking?
  - Just pure luck!
- - Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
  - Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this
    country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's
    the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country
    out of the doldrums.
- - Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community.
    I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
  - I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In
    these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
- - I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
  - Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an
    offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank
    on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as
    faith!
  - Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
- - We want to talk to you.
  - What about?
  - We'll discuss that in the board room.
- - We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day
    to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
  - What do you mean, help?
  - I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout
    the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
  - That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
  - I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
- - The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought
    they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help
    from them?
  - Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
  - No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you
    to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith
    and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot
    of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get
    it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
  - So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well,
    I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
- - Say, you can't do that
  - I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour,
    I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in
    tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will
    be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But
    I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
- - Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
  - The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
- - Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
  - We've been waiting fifteen minutes
  - You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a
    demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
- - Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all
    right.
  - Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city.
    We're fools to tolerate it.
- - Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
  - Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
  - What good will that do?
  - What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody
    else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's
    what good it will do!
- - How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
  - Take it easy, Clark.
- - You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
  - All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run
    the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
- - Mr. Dickson in yet?
  - Not yet, Mr. Clark.
  - When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
  - Yes, sir.
  - And tell him not to delay.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
  - How much?
  - About twenty-four thousand.
  - It was more than that last week.
  - Yeah.
  - Here's twenty-five thousand.
- - Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
  - Yeah.
  - Let me have ten bucks?
  - Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
  - Charlie!
  - Yeah?
- - I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will
    you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
  - Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
- - Whose death?
  - It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
  - Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
  - Aw, nerts!
- - Where you been?
  - Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
- - What's the matter, Charlie?
  - I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me
    with a date, too.
  - I remember once when your account checked.
  - Yeah.
- - And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock,
    so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
  - Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
- - Oscar, what's the matter?
  - I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the
    watchman lying dead at my feet.
  - No kidding?
  - No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
  - Where's Matt?
  - Matt?
  - Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
  - The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
  - He has?
  - Yeah.
- - Hello, Tom.
  - You here again? What do you want?
- - What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
  - Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
  - I want to know why .
- - Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke
    you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the
    greatest
  - I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you
    can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
  - But listen, Tom, I
- - What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
  - She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
  - Why not?
- - If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
  - Yes - sure
  - Yeah - sure!
- - No, thank you.
  - I'd like some tea, please.
- - Sorry.
  - Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
- - He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves
    against one man.
  - Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by
    some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it
    a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by
    the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler,
    if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible
    shock.
  - Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
  - And what, Sergeant?
  - I don't rightly know, sir.
  - That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed.
    We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
- - I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We
    will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
  - We'll find him, not to worry.
- - Do you have any hot soup?
  - No.
- - Hot chocolate?
  - We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
  - Then you have some hot tea?
  - No.
  - Oh.
  - But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
- - Remember the Alamo?
  - I beg your pardon?
- - Hello, there. What can I get you?
  - Campari and soda would do nicely.
  - Sorry, love.
  - I suppose Guinness will suffice.
- - What's that?
  - Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but
    it's traditional, so we left it.
  - I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
- - Yes?
  - Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
  - Send them in.
- - Excuse me.  Yes?
  - Roger Mathison, Doctor.
  - What here?
  - He's on the telephone.
  - Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something.
    Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
- - Dr. Hirsch?
  - Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
- - No, thank you, Doctor.
  - Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
- - You were saying?
  - Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
  - Why don't we ask him?
- - The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true,
    but I hardly think...
  - Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing
    and that we must find him.
- - What can we do to assist you?
  - Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
- - Are you cold?
  - Yes.
  - Good.
- - Jack.
  - David.
  - You're not having a good time are you?
  - Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
- - Well, I like it here.
  - I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
  - Right.
- - Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
  - I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
  - Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
  - She's a jerk.
  - You're talking about the woman I love.
  - I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
  - Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
  - I don't know.
  - Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that
    shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie
    expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
  - If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
  - I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
  - It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
  - It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
  - We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is
    that?
  - She says she 'likes me too much'.
- - The Slaughtered Lamb?
  - Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on
    a spear as their symbol?
  - That's a wolf's head.
  - Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head
    on a spear as their symbol?
  - That's not a spear. It's a pike.
  - A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
  - David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens
    to us - it's your fault.
  - I assume full responsibility.
  - Okay.
  - Shall we?
- - Hello.
  - Nice to see you.
- - Nice looking group.
  - Listen, at least it's warm in here.
  - Look at that.
- - What about it?
  - It's a five-pointed star.
  - Maybe the owners are from Texas.
- - Ask them what the candles are for.
  - You ask them.
  - Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon
    Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
  - I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off
    monsters.
  - Right.
  - Wrong.
- - Go on, ask them.
  - You ask them.
- - Jack, we'd better go.
  - What do you mean? I'm starving.
- - Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
  - Apparently so.
- - What the hell was that all about?
  - I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
  - Beware the moon?
  - Come on, I'm freezing.
- - That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
  - I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure
    I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
  - Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
- - What do you think was wrong?
  - I have no idea.
  - Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
  - I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
- - Say, David...
  - I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank
    you.
- - Did you hear that?
  - I heard that.
  - What was it?
- - Could be a lot of things.
  - Yeah?
  - A coyote.
  - There aren't any coyotes in England.
  - The Hound of the Baskervilles.
  - Pecos Bill.
  - Heathcliffe.
  - Heathcliffe didn't howl.
  - No, but he was on the moors.
  - It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
- - I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
  - Yeah.
- - Shit! David, what is that?
  - I don't know. Come on.
  - Come on, where?
  - Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
- - It's moving.
  - It's circling us.
- - What's the plan?
  - Plan?
  - Let's just keep walking.
- - It's in front of us.
  - Do you think it's a dog?
- - Oh shit. What is that?
  - A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
- - Nice doggie. Good boy.
  - Walk away, Jack.
  - Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
- - See anything?
  - No.
- - It sounds far away.
  - Not far enough. Come on.
- - Jack?
  - Yeah.
  - Where are we going?
  - I'll tell you when we get there.
  - Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
- - You really scared me, you shithead.
  - Are you going to help me up?
- - Nice to see you.
  - Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
  - Thanks a lot.
  - This is too much. I can't handle this.
  - I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
- - David! You're hurting my feelings.
  - Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have
    you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
  - I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
  - Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
  - Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
  - Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
  - Debbie Klein cried a lot.
  - I can't stand it.
  - So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in
    Rudy Levine's bed.
  - Rudy Levine the shmuck?
  - Life mocks me even in death.
- - I'm going completely crazy.
  - David!
  - What?!
  - David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
  - Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
  - I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've
    got to know.
  - If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share
    one's breakfast with the living dead!
  - We were attacked by a werewolf.
  - I'm not listening!
  - On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
  - Shut up, you zombie!
  - I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the
    werewolf's curse is lifted.
  - What's wrong with you? Shut up!
  - The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
  - Will you be quiet?!
- - It's you, David.
  - What?!
  - You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
  - What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
  - Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
  - Stop it, Jack.
  - Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
  - Jack, please go away. Please go away.
  - You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
  - You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
  - David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the
    bloodshed before it begins.
  - Nurse!
  - Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
  - Nurse!
  - The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide,
    David. Join me.
  - Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
  - It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked
    to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
- - You're not real.
  - Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
- - What are you doing here?
  - I wanted to see you.
  - Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
  - David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going
    on.
  - I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
  - Yes.
  - Get out of here, Jack!
  - David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
  - A monster. I know, I know.
  - You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
  - Jack, are you really dead?
  - What do you think?
  - I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're
    a part of another bad dream.
  - You must believe me.
  - What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs
    and eat people? Bullshit!
  - The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe
    me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't
    allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
  - I will not accept this! Now go away!
- - Hi, Jack.
  - Hi, David.
- - What can I say, Jack?
  - You don't have to say anything.
  - Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
  - If I was still alive, I probably would.
  - You look awful.
  - Thank you.
  - I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who
    killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
  - What about the zoo?
  - Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that.
    I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you,
    Jack.
  - I want you to meet some people.
- - David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
  - Hello.
  - Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see
    him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
- - Because this must be stopped.
  - How shall I do it?
- - I could hang myself.
  - If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
- - Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
  - Where am I?
  - You're in a hospital in London.
  - London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
  - I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
  - The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
  - Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
- - Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
  - Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
- - How long have I been here?
  - You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
  - Two weeks?
  - You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but
    nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars
    to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad
    man has the strength of ten.
  - Lunatic?
  - Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now.
    Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
- - There were witnesses?
  - So they said.
  - How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell
    and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand
    what they're talking about.
  - In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
  - Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
- - You've never had bad dreams before?
  - Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
- - Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
  - I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid
    dog.
  - Yes.
  - Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw
    him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
  - You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
  - Did you see Jack?
  - No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
  - Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered
    Lamb?
  - I really don't know.
  - Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must
    have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
  - David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out
    roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
  - You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
  - Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan
    Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered
    your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
- - Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
  - Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
- - Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
  - I was having a nightmare.
- - Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
  - What time is it?
  - It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
  - Alex?
  - Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
  - What are you going to see?
  - An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to
    see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
  - Do you have bad dreams, too?
  - Some, everyone does.
  - Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
  - Bambi?
- - Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
  - No, but we're about to.
- - You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
  - Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
- - All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
  - Oh, come on, tell us.
  - No. You've had your chance.
- - Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York.
    It was full of men from the United Nations.
  - That's very funny, that is.
- - No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
  - You could have told them!
- - Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
  - This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of
    your carnivorous lunar activities.
  - Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
  - You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that
    I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed
    and the curse lifted.
- - That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
  - No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
  - Why are you doing this to me?
- - Officer, I killed those people last night.
  - You did, did you?
- - All right, you two, move along.
  - Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
  - There's no call for that kind of language.
  - Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full
    of shit!
  - Now see here young man.
  - Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
- - Who is this girl?
  - You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
  - That's what I want you to do, you moron!
- - Miss Price.
  - Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
  - Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only
    to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
  - Has he been refusing food?
  - Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what
    is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand
    to hold.
  - Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
- - He all right?
  - Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
  - He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy
    fellows to see him.
  - Chart says he's from New York.
  - I think he's a Jew.
  - Why on earth do you say that?
  - I looked.
  - Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice
    now.
- - Hello, Benjamin.
  - No.
  - No what?
  - No.
  - Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
  - No.
- - Feeling better?
  - No.
  - The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have
    some lovely funny Beanos.
  - No.
  - Right.
- - How are we feeling tonight?
  - No.
  - No what?
  - No!
  - Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
  - No.
  - I thought not.
- - It wasn't a lunatic.
  - I beg your pardon?
  - It was a wolf.
  - What?
  - A wolf.
- - Mr. Kessler?
  - Yes?
  - You haven't eaten your lunch.
  - I'm not very hungry, thank you.
  - I'm afraid you have to eat something.
  - Please, really. I'm not hungry.
  - You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
  - How is that?
  - Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I
    be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
  - Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
  - Sorry.
- - Aw come on, Miss Price!
  - Call me Alex.
  - Aw come on, Alex!
  - Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
- - Call me David.
  - Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
  - This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
  - Right.
- - Let's try a little harder, shall we?
  - Will you give me a break?
- - You're a very beautiful girl.
  - I thought you were asleep.
  - I was. What are you reading?
  - '''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur''s Court'' by Mark Twain.'
  - Do you like it?
  - I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
- - What do you dream about?
  - I dream of death mostly.
  - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
  - It's okay. I want to talk to you.
- - How old are you?
  - That's not really a very proper question.
  - How old are you?
  - Twenty-eight.
  - I'm twenty-seven.
  - I know.
  - Now what do you want to talk about?
  - Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
  - My best friend. My very best friend.
  - Shall I read to you?
  - What? Oh, yes, please.
  - 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur''s Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after
    the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?'
  - Yes, go on.
  - 'Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the
    curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things:
    his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness
    of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people
    will in the tail of the herd...'
- - Hello. You all right?
  - I'm sorry I woke you up.
  - Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
  - No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
  - That's easy enough.
  - I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't
    seem to stop them.
  - David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and
    then this will all fade away.
  - Will you come with me?
  - What?
  - I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect
    relationship.
  - Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
  - Will you think about it?
  - How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
  - Not just a patient -- me.
  - You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
  - Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse
    seemed like just the thing to do it.
  - All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
  - Now I'm embarrassed.
  - Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
- - I'm a werewolf.
  - A werewolf?
- - Are you better now?
  - I'll let you know the next full moon.
  - You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
- - My friend Jack was just here.
  - Your dead friend Jack?
  - Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
  - What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in
    two days or about visits from dead friends?
  - I was dreaming again?
  - I would think so.
  - Yeah, I would think so, too.
- - The kitchen.
  - Very nice.
- - Closet.
  - Charming.
  - Bathroom.
  - Lovely.
  - The bedroom.
  - There is only one bed.
  - David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
- - It's nice to see you.
  - It's nice to see you.
- - Alex?
  - Yes?
  - Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
  - Of course.
  - Good.
- - David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the
    grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
  - I was awake and he was in my room.
  - But, David.
  - I wasn't hallucinating.
- - Tomorrow is the full moon.
  - That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
- - Let me go now, you'll make me late.
  - Do me an enormous favor?
  - Anything.
  - Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
  - It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
  - Werewolves simply do not exist.
  - David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
  - Yeah, I do, but go to work.
- - Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
  - Okay.
  - I've left those pills for you.
  - A doper werewolf.
- - I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
  - See you later.
- - David! Where on earth have you been!?!
  - I'm freezing.
- - Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
  - The zoo?
  - Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane.
    What did I do last night, Alex?
  - Don't you remember?
  - I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came
    in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the
    zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
- - The next corner we can get a cab.
  - I should be committed.
  - Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
  - I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
- - But...
  - Pull over.
- - David, what are you doing?
  - Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
  - David, stop!
- - I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
  - Jack is dead!
  - Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
- - David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
  - Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
- - He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
  - What?
  - We had an argument. He's being silly.
  - I swear, I don't know this girl.
- - Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
  - Will you shut up!?!!
- - Hopeless. It's hopeless.
  - David, let's go now.
- - Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here!
    I've got to do something!
  - David, don't lose control.
  - Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
- - Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
  - Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
- - Can I be of service, Miss Price?
  - Dr. Hirsch?
  - Go about your duties.
  - Yes, Doctor.
- - Oh, Miss Price?
  - Yes, Doctor?
  - What exactly did he call out?
  - He said 'Jack'.
  - That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
  - What happened to them?
  - The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very
    powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss
    Price.
  - No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
- - Did he say a wolf?
  - Yes, I believe he did.
- - It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
  - Come to my office, Miss Price.
- - Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't
    give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
  - Yes, sir.
  - It's a full moon. Where is he?
  - At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
- - He's not?
  - Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
  - Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
  - Has his friend appeared to him again?
  - Yes.
  - What did he say?
  - David says Jack comes to warn him.
  - Warn him?
  - Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
  - I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and
    now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed
    when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The
    Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub
    in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
  - Yes.
  - They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community
    is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
  - And what else?
  - I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm
    convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
- - You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
  - No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
- - Surely you're not suggesting...
  - David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis
    in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by
    a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack
    by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
  - Dr. Hirsch?
  - Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such
    a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
  - What shall we do?
  - Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
- - He's here.
  - Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
  - He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
  - The zoo? Is he rational?
  - Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what
    you mean.
  - Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
  - No, why?
  - Is David acting strangely?
  - No, not really.
- - Could you get here without any trouble?
  - Yes, I should think so.
  - Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my
    care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring
    him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
  - Yes, Doctor.
  - You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
  - He's fine. We'll come right over.
  - Shall I send a car?
  - No, a cab will be faster.
  - I expect you shortly.
- - What shall we do?
  - Tea would be nice.
- - Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort
    of mad dog.
  - David?
  - I doubt it. But it's something to do.
- - Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
  - The American? Yes, duck.
  - How did he look?
  - What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
  - You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
  - I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little
    say what happens to them.
  - Thank you.
- - Herr Salieri.
  - Yes, I am looking after him.
  - Can we come in?
  - Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
  - But he's all right?
  - Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
  - Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
  - Of course.
  - And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the
    audience shouted his name a hundred times.
  - Bene.
  - I'll call tomorrow.
  - Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
- - Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
  - Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
- - Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
  - Who is she?
  - She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
  - Excuse me, my dear.
- - That lady is back, sir.
  - Show her in. Then go to bed.
- - What does he want?
  - He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted
    on waiting.
  - Come with me. And stay in the room.
- - This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and
    he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
  - I agree, Baron.
  - Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my
    best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what
    I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
  - No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically
    the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't
    think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
  - How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
  - Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could
    commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
- - Here I am, my angel.
  - What? Who the devil are you?
  - I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
  - Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
- - Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then
    you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
  - I can't wait.
  - Well, promise then.
  - What do you mean - now?
  - Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
- - Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird,
    but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
  - Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
- - Bravo, Your Majesty!
  - Well done, Sire!
- - Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
  - Did we?
- - I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh
    my memory, Herr Director?
  - For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
  - Oh yes, yes. And that was?
  - Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes
    him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation,
    as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
  - Ah.
- - I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
  - Yes?
  - Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
  - Italian?
- - You mean that play?
  - Exactly.
  - He's setting that play to music?
  - Yes.
  - You must be mad.
- - Are you absolutely sure?
  - I've seen the manuscript.
  - Where?
  - Never mind.
- - Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
  - Incredible.
  - The Emperor has given him permission.
- - What anger?
  - About the ballet.
  - Ballet? What ballet?
  - Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
  - Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
  - Yes, in the third act.
- - What do you want?
  - I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to
    someone.
  - About what?
  - You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
  - So?
  - In the sight of God that is a sin.
  - What do you want?
  - Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
  - Leave me alone.
  - I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
  - Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
  - That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
  - Are they?
  - Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
  - I do not seek forgiveness.
  - My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here
    only for you. Please talk to me.
  - How well are you trained in music?
  - I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
  - Where?
  - Here in Vienna.
  - Then you must know this.
- - I can't say I do. What is it?
  - I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it.
    How about this?
- - Well?
  - I regret it is not too familiar.
  - Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when
    you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
- - Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
  - I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
  - Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
  - Ah - you've heard that?
  - All Vienna has heard that.
  - And do they believe it?
  - Is it true?
  - Do you believe it?
  - Should I?
- - Do you hear me?
  - He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
- - It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural
    lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all
    directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it
    possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the
    face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the
    same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling
    up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began
    to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
  - Did you try?
  - Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
- - 'Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient,
    hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer?
    I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace
    of art. And I was nothing to God.'
  - You cannot say that!
  - No? Was Mozart a good man?
  - God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the
    salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all
    merciful. That is all you need to know.
  - All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that
    longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve
    Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the
    talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
  - My son, no one can speak for God.
  - Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
  - I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
  - Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of
    Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
- - What?
  - 'His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin,
    Mozart''s little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A
    divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for
    Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity!
    What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last.
    And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for
    once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?'
  - Yes.
  - The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How
    does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when
    you have to do it, with your own hands.
- - Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill
    him.
  - I did.
  - No, you didn't!
  - I poisoned his life.
  - But not his body.
  - What difference does that make?
  - My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your
    penance? Is it?
  - No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking
    of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing.
    And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity
    - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion
    he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
  - Oh my son, my poor son!
  - Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I.
    Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than
    let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care.
    Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for
    the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw
    him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
- - I don't think it was really decided, Director.
  - Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
- - My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that
    subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
  - Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their!
    their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German
    virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
- - Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
  - Baron!
- - Mozart -
  - Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the
    same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with
    music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise
    - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
  - Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment
    of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing
    would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely
    you can choose more elevated themes?
  - Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is
    - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated
    things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
  - Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal
    in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much
    as His Majesty.
- - What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
  - What is what?
  - Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach
    a sixteen-year-old girl.
  - Because His Majesty wishes it.
  - Is the Emperor angry with me?
  - On the contrary.
  - Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
  - Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
  - No, but I'm the best.
  - A little modesty would suit you better.
  - Who is on this committee?
  - Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
  - Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
  - Mozart -
  - They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality.
    Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba!
    Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
  - Mozart -
  - Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza!
    Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
  - Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your
    stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
  - 'Must I? Well, I won''t! I tell you straight: I will not!'
- - Herr Mozart -
  - May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
- - Oh? Have I seen it?
  - I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of
    course, I'll show it to you immediately.
  - I think you'd better.
- - You mean in Turkey?
  - Exactly.
  - Then why especially does it have to be in German?
  - Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
- - What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that
    counts.
  - But, Your Majesty -
- - That will do, Herr Mozart!
  - Just let me tell you how it begins.
- - Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
  - Certainly, Herr Director.
- - Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
  - Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
  - Exactly. A dance.
  - But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
  - It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score,
    please.
- - What are you doing, Herr Director?
  - Taking out what you should never have put in.
- - Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
  - Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
- - I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations
    on a melody of yours?
  - Really?
  - Mio caro Adone.
  - Ah!
  - A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
- - Love, Sire!
  - Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
- - Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
  - But this is absurd!
- - Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
  - Did you like it, then?
  - How could I not?
  - It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
- - Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
  - Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't
    have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at
    these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married
    man now.
  - So you are. How is your pretty wife?
  - She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told
    me last night. You are the first to know.
  - I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
  - So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
- - Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation.
    Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
  - Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what
    you wanted?
  - I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
  - Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please,
    can't you help me? Please!
  - My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is
    too late.
  - Whom did they choose?
  - Herr Sommer.
  - Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
  - 'No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.'
  - But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the
    palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice.
    He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
  - An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical
    harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
- - Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
  - You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
  - No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
  - It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your
    means.
  - How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing
    at all!
  - How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
  - They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none
    will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their
    daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
  - Of course not.
  - Do you have a daughter?
  - I'm afraid not.
  - Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for
    free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should
    put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan?
    Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
    I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working
    on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
  - Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
  - I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
  - Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
  - Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
  - Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
  - Ah. Italian?
  - Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
  - Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
  - What exactly are you working on?
  - I can't say. Really
  - I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However,
    I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter.
    Will that do?
- - Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
  - It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music.
    Pages of it.
  - Really? Why?
  - I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it
    is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
  - Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
  - Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera
    on the fire, he made me so angry!
  - You burned the score?
  - Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
  - How fortunate.
  - It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
  - But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the
    Emperor.
  - Oh, Excellency, would you?
  - With all my heart, Mozart.
  - Thank you! Oh, thank you.
- - Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
  - I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has
    to accept the fact gracefully.
  - But what is it they don't like?
  - Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear.
    The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
  - What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
  - I think it's marvelous. Truly.
  - It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
  - I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't
    even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
  - I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
  - I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you
    to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
  - Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
  - Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
  - Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
- - Mozart. It was good of you to come.
  - How could I not?
  - Did my work please you?
  - How could it not, Excellency?
  - Yes?
  - I never knew that music like that was possible.
  - You flatter me.
  - Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
- - I have come to commission work from you.
  - What work?
  - A Mass for the dead.
  - What dead? Who is dead?
  - A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
  - Who are you?
  - I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
  - How much?
- - How long will you give me?
  - Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
- - I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
  - Are you neglecting my request?
  - No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
- - What happened? Is it over?
  - I'm taking you home. You're not well.
  - No, no. I have to get back. I have -
- - Where is your wife?
  - Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
  - You mean she's not coming back?
  - You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
  - No, please.
  - I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
- - I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
  - This is only a vaudeville.
  - Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest
    composer known to me.
  - Do you mean that?
  - I do.
  - I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think
    stupid things.
  - Are you ill?
  - The doctor thinks I am. But -
  - What?
  - I'm too young to be so sick.
- - Shall I answer it?
  - No! No, it's him!
  - Who?
  - The man. He's here.
  - What man?
- - Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would
    help me finish it.
  - Finish what?
  - He knows. He knows!
- - Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
  - Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
  - Would you? Actually, you could.
  - My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
  - But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
  - Of course.
  - You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm
    dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
  - Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this
    work?
  - A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
- - Where did I stop?
  - The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
  - So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded.
    Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
  - Consigned to flames of woe.
  - Do you believe in it?
  - What?
  - A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
  - Oh, yes.
  - Strange!
  - Come. Let's begin.
- - Confutatis Maledictis.
  - We ended in F Major?
  - Yes.
  - So now - A minor. Suddenly.
- - The Fire.
  - What time?
  - Common time.
- - Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second
    measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
  - Yes.
  - Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And
    fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do
    you have that?
  - I think so.
  - Sing it back.
- - Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second
    measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
  - Yes.
  - Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus
    ad-dic-tis.
- - Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical
    notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
  - Please! Just one moment.
- - It couldn't be simpler.
  - First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
  - With the tenors.
  - Also identical?
  - Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and
    dominant.
- - And that's all?
  - Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
- - Do you have me?
  - I think so.
  - Show me.
- - That's wonderful!
  - 'Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce,
    pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.'
- - C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca
    me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
  - Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
  - Yes, and on 'dictis'.
  - Yes!
- - And that's it. Do you have it?
  - You go fast!
  - Do you have it?
  - Yes.
  - Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
- - Do you want to rest a bit?
  - Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
  - We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
  - I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
  - Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
  - I'm not leaving you.
  - I am so ashamed.
  - What for?
  - I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive
    me!
- - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention,
    they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them.
    They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
  - And which one of them do you want me to teach?
  - What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah!
    Come this way.
- - You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
  - Madame.
  - This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach
    our Gertrude. Where is she?
- - I'm afraid I am.
  - Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
- - Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
  - Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
- - Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I
    right, Herr Mozart?
  - Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
- - It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
  - Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your
    dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
- - Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
  - Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
  - Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
  - Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
  - What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
  - Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me
    with a little money instead?
  - What for?
  - If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
  - Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
  - No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine,
    you should offer yours.
- - I'm sorry. No.
  - Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
  - My answer is no, Mozart.
- - Sssh!
  - Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
  - Sssh! Stay here.
- - What did he say? What did he say?
  - Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
- - Well?
  - Sublime! Utterly sublime!
  - That kind of music should be punishable by death.
- - Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
  - Yes, well, it's all good fun.
  - I liked the horse.
- - Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell
    you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm
    not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
  - I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
  - '''Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could
    do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That''s what people
    want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic
    tricks and you''ll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you''d
    have to put a fire in it, because I''ve got the best fire machine in the city
    and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life.
    Oh, and a few trick animals. You''d have to use those.'
  - Animals?
  - I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds
    up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
- - I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll
    guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
  - German!
  - Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
  - No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German
    since Seraglio.
  - So there you are. What do you say?
- - Leave that alone!
  - Wolfi!
  - Put it down!
  - What is this?
  - Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
  - Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
  - What?
  - What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
  - Yes.
  - Can I see it?
  - No.
  - Why not?
  - Because there's nothing to see.
- - Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
  - Well, we can.
  - So let me see it. Where is it?
- - Yes?
  - Are you Herr Mozart?
  - That's right.
  - My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my
    services to you.
  - What?
  - They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
- - Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to
    know who he is?
  - Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
- - Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
  - Good morning, sir.
  - What have you got for me today? Let me see.
- - Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
  - I will, sir.
- - Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
  - Yes, thank you, sir.
  - Bene! Bene!
- - Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
  - Bene.
- - Oh, thank you, sir.
  - Do any pupils come to the house?
  - Not that I've seen.
  - Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
  - Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits
    there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
  - Really? What is it he's writing?
  - Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
  - Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're
    sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
- - I think I've found out about the money, sir.
  - Yes what?
- - Where does he work?
  - In there, sir.
- - Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
  - I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
  - Why? What has happened?
  - You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then
    takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
  - What medicine?
  - I don't know. He has pains.
  - Where?
  - Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
  - Is he working?
  - I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know
    he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
  - Is he working?
  - I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
  - Opera? Opera!
  - Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
  - Are you sure it's an opera?
- - I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps
    toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As
    you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and
    await my coming.
  - I will.
- - Why are you here?
  - Am I not welcome?
  - Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
- - Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's
    the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
  - Is she not here?
  - I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
- - Do you always live like this?
  - Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi
    - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's
    like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
- - 'She''s very tired, poor creature. You know me: I''m a real pig. It''s not so
    easy cleaning up after me.'
  - Don't you have a maid?
  - Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything
    herself.
  - How is your financial situation?
  - It couldn't be better.
  - That's not what I hear.
  - What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me
    here.
  - They say you're in debt.
  - Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
  - How many pupils do you have?
  - Pupils?
  - Yes.
  - Yes.
  - How many?
  - I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the
    way. I've got to have time for composition.
  - Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
  - This one will.
- - What's that?
  - Oh, let's not talk about it.
  - Why not?
  - It's a secret.
  - You don't have secrets from me.
  - It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
- - Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
  - Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
  - Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
- - Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
  - Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable,
    missable, suddenly visible Papa!
- - No, really!
  - This is just a game, Papa.
- - Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
  - I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
- - I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
  - But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
- - Papa, is this your idea?
  - Mine?
- - Are you playing a trick on me?
  - I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
- - Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
  - Papa!
  - Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
  - No one calls you that.
  - She does. She says I sleep all day.
- - Father -
  - 'Hush! I''m talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing
    - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude
    they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us:
    ''Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'''
- - Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good
    German composer in Vienna, surely?
  - I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in
    the pay of the Archbishop.
  - Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.
    Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
- - Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
  - In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German.
    For plain people.
- - Yes, sir.
  - Well. There it is.
- - Well, what do you have for me today?
  - Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
  - Yes, what about him?
  - He's here.
  - Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
- - Your Majesty!
  - No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this
    very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was
    giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped
    and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he
    did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
- - Oh, thank you.
  - The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
  - Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
- - And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome
    for you.
  - Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore
    brilliante e famossissimo!
- - Majesty!
  - Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
- - Why so?
  - Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
- - Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
  - It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a
    - in a -
- - Yes, where?
  - In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
  - Ah-ha.
- - Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
  - What? On one hearing only?
  - I think so, Sire, yes.
- - It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
  - Yes, indeed.
  - And German?
  - Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
  - So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
  - Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it
    gets a touch elaborate.
  - What do you mean, Sire?
  - Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one
    say, Director?
- - I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither
    more nor less.
  - My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course
    of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
- - My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality
    work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be
    perfect.
  - Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
- - Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
  - Enchanted, Madame.
- - Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
  - Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely.
    Not altogether.
- - Excuse me, but how old are you?
  - Twenty-six.
  - Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
- - Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
  - Thank you, Sire!
- - Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
  - What is it?
  - May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon
    to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole
    stay so memorable for him.
  - Ah! By all means.
- - Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for
    our theatre?
  - Yes, Sire.
  - Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
  - Who told you this, Majesty?
  - It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
  - Well, yes, I admit it is.
  - Would you tell me why?
  - Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
- - Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have
    good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In
    France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes
    me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to
    see the same fears starting here.
  - Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have
    taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
  - I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot
    afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
- - But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
  - Ah, love again.
  - But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example,
    I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling.
    Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny
    situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes
    in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet,
    and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain
    that?
  - I have no idea.
  - Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then
    double it.
  - Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
  - Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
- - Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
  - You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
  - Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
- - I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should
    really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
  - You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain,
    arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
- - What a charming idea. May I see?
  - It's just a trifle, of course.
  - May I try it?
  - Majesty.
- - Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
  - You do me too much honour, Sire.
  - Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need
    a minute to practice.
- - A-flat, Majesty.
  - Ah-ha!
- - And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
  - Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
- - My pleasure.
  - Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera
    from you. What do you say?
- - Well, I'm glad to hear that.
  - Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would
    love to learn.
  - Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
- - Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
  - Your Highness.
- - Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
  - I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
- - An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
  - Yes?
  - You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
  - And the result satisfies.
  - Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
  - Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
  - I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps
    put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select
    according to Your Majesty's wishes.
  - You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
  - Sire.
  - Well. There it is.
- - I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
  - Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I
    simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
  - Why not?
  - Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why
    he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
  - Oh?
- - Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
  - Of course not.
  - I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
  - Really?
  - As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she
    was - er - well!
  - Yes?
  - Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
- - Do you like this, Salieri?
  - It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
  - Well, look at them.
- - Really?
  - Ah, now! Here she comes.
- - Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
  - I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
  - Wine?
- - Just one year.
  - Who was your teacher?
  - I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
  - Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
- - Upstairs.
  - Gertrude!
  - You can't be Herr Mozart!
- - I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
  - Gertrude!
  - It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
  - People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you
    think she stinks, say so.
  - Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really
    very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
- - I said play!
  - Michael!
- - What a strange young man.
  - Yes. He is a little strange.
- - Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
  - I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
  - Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
  - I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
  - Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
- - I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
  - Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
- - Be careful!
  - Be careful!
- - He's adorable!
  - Adorable!
- - Behold!
  - Behold!
- - Hey!
  - Hey!
- - Behold!
  - Behold!
- - I see that you're expecting.
  - Oh, yes.
  - When, may I ask?
  - In three months! Papa.
- - What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People
    send us gifts all the time.
  - But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
  - Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
- - And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
  - And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
  - Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
  - So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
  - Do you hear him? Do you?
- - How much will you pay him?
  - Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about
    half the receipts?
- - Am I interrupting something?
  - Not at all.
  - Where's our friend?
  - He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
  - I hope so. I need it immediately.
- - Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you
    know how many people are waiting?
  - Leave him alone!
  - I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
  - He's doing his best.
  - I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
  - You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot
    would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
  - Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
  - Money! Money!
  - You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
  - Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
- - Excellency!
  - Madame. How can I help you?
- - Frau Mozart?
  - That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing
    some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
  - How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
  - He's terribly busy, sir.
  - I understand.
- - I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please
    give him my warmest.
  - Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
  - I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure
    you they will be quite safe.
  - I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
  - Really?
  - My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
  - Then he didn't send you?
  - No, sir. This is my own idea.
  - I see.
  - Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than
    he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day
    long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's
    really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for
    it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
- - Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
  - Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court
    Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
- - Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things
    you might like.
  - That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic
    if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
  - Originals?
  - Yes.
- - These are originals?
  - Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
- - It is miraculous.
  - Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
- - Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
  - Oh, thank you, sir!
- - Come back tonight.
  - Tonight?
  - Alone.
  - What for?
  - Some service deserves service in return. No?
  - What do you mean?
  - Isn't it obvious?
- - It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
  - But! I'm a married woman!
  - Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
- - I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we
    go?
  - What?
  - Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they
    here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
- - What are you doing here?
  - Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
  - Why you?
  - I was at hand.
  - Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
  - He needs me, ma'am.
  - No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
  - He asked me to stay.
  - And I'm asking you -
- - This is not his handwriting.
  - No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
  - He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
- - I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and
    go.
  - Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
- - Stop it!
  - I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are
    going back.
- - No! No! No!
  - Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
  - Where?
  - We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
  - Fartsbishop!
- - Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
  - Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
  - Why not?
  - Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards,
    sing backwards, and talk backwards.
  - That's stupid.
  - Why? People fart backwards.
  - Do you think that's funny?
  - Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
- - Oh, ha, ha, ha.
  - Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
  - Yes, you are. You're very sick.
  - No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
  - Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
  - Em iram! Em iram!
  - No, I'm not playing this game.
  - No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
  - No!
  - Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
  - Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend.
    A dirty fiend at that.
  - Ui-vol-i-tub!
  - Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
- - Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
  - What?
  - Tish-I'm-tee.
  - Eat
  - Yes.
  - Eat my - ah!
- - Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
  - Of course.
- - I think you're mad! You're really mad!
  - Oh, leave me alone.
  - One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for
    life!
  - They'll come anyway. They love me here.
  - No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
  - Oh yes? You always know everything.
  - Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
  - You borrowed money from your mother?
  - Yes!
  - Well, don't do that again!
  - How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
  - Don't be stupid.
  - All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
  - Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
  - This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
- - Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door
    waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
  - Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
  - What's the matter with you?
  - Tell them to go!
  - Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
  - No!
  - Yes!
  - I love you! I love you!
- - My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could
    you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
  - Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
  - He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
- - May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
  - Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea,
    Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
  - Wolfi!
  - What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
  - Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
- - There's a young girl to see you.
  - What does she want?
  - I don't know.
  - Well, ask her!
  - She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
  - Oh, damn!
- - Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can
    possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think
    you can -
  - Stanzi!
  - No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right
    for you, can we?
- - We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This
    is! a very nice girl.
  - Wolfi.
  - Yes, my love?
  - These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
  - Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend
    the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good
    news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with!
    Done with!
  - Wolfi! Your father is dead.
  - What?
  - Your father is dead.
- - Half the receipts! Stanzi!
  - I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
- - You're not going to do this?
  - Why not? Half the house!
  - When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
  - Oh, Stanzi.
  - I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was
    common.
  - Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
  - Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
  - Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
  - Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
- - Who was that?
  - No one.
  - I heard voices.
- - What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
  - I'm not telling you.
  - Why not?
  - You'd think I was mad.
- - No. Don't answer it!
  - Why?
- - This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
  - Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
  - Give me two more weeks. Please.
- - Give me one reason I can understand.
  - I can't write it!
  - Why not?
  - It's killing me.
- - Go back to bed.
  - Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all
    word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
- - What is it?
  - I want to go!
  - Where?
  - I want to go back to Vienna.
  - Now?
  - Yes!
  - Why?
  - I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
  - What are you talking about?
- - Don Giovannnnnnnni!
  - Who the devil are you? What do you want?
  - I've come to dinnnnnner!
  - Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
  - Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
- - In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not
    a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
  - Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
- - Why what, sir?
  - Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
  - Humiliated?
  - How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the
    more you take.
- - If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
  - I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there
    patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
  - No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me.
    It's obvious I don't satisfy.
  - Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain
    in my service and learn your place. Go now.
- - No! I won't have him back.
  - But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you.
    Your protection, your understanding.
  - Hardly.
  - Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese
    slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to
    see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
  - I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship.
    He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
  - Sir -
  - Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
  - Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too
    indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let
    me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
  - And how will you make him keep it?
  - Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one
    more chance.
  - You have leave to try.
  - Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
- - Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria
    for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water.
    Her mother is lying on the stage.
  - Don't bother!
  - What?
  - Don't bother.
  - I'll be right back.
- - Oh - excuse me!
  - Is her mother still lying on the floor?
  - No, she's fine.
  - I'm so relieved.
- - Is she a good fuck?
  - What??
  - I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason
    you'd marry someone like that.
- - No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce
    us, Wolfgang?
  - Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
- - Maestro.
  - Good morning.
  - Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going
    to be Turkish this year!
  - Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
  - Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
  - Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
  - And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
  - Yes.
  - Is there a part for me?
  - No.
  - How do you know?
  - Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
  - Why not?
  - Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
  - Where?
  - In a harem.
  - What's that?
  - A brothel.
  - Oh!
  - A Turkish brothel.
  - Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
  - My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna
    as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
- - Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
  - Perhaps.
- - What does he look like?
  - You might be disappointed.
  - Why?
  - Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
  - Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
- - Did you know? Had you heard?
  - What?
  - The marriage!
  - Well, what does it matter to you?
  - Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
- - How was I? Tell me honestly.
  - You were sublime.
  - What did you think of the music?
  - Extremely clever.
  - Meaning you didn't like it.
- - Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
  - Certainly!
- - Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
  - Indeed.
  - These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
  - His Grace is very angry with you.
  - What do you mean?
- - A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey
    dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my
    most tasty little dish!
  - Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking.
    The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would
    be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better
    than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
  - A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey
    dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
  - I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't
    fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But
    if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must
    fade! To a ghost I must fade!
  - A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey
    dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
  - At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one
    little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only
    peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to
    heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
- - Look, I told you...
  - It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you
    allegedly picked up.
- - The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found
    no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
  - That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
- - Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back
    on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
    Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find
    it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little
    surprise...
  - Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
  - '...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve
    hours of hatching...'
- - Why won't you check out LV-426?
  - Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and
    they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they
    call it Acheron now.
  - What are you talking about. What people?
- - How many colonists?
  - Sixty, maybe seventy families.
  - Sweet Jesus.
- - What did you say?
  - Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
- - Casey.  She's my only friend.
  - What about me?
- - I don't want you for a friend.
  - Why not?
  - Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead
    and you'll leave me alone.
- - They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
  - They're dead.
  - Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
  - You promise?
  - Cross my heart.
  - And hope to die?
- - I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
  - The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
  - Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide
    better than anybody.
  - You're really something, ace.
- - I guess we're not leaving, right?
  - I'm sorry, Newt.
  - You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
- - Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
  - I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
- - Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
  - Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
  - My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
- - Yes, there are, aren't there.
  - Why do they tell little kids that?
- - Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
  - Did one of those things grow inside her?
- - I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
  - Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
  - No, it's different, honey.
  - Did you ever have a baby?
  - Yes.  A little girl.
  - Where is she?
  - Gone.
  - You mean dead.
- - Don't go!  Please.
  - I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera
    right up there.
- - Newt.  Newt, wake up.
  - Wah...?  Where are...?
  - Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
- - Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
  - I know, honey.  Me too.
- - Burke!  Open the door!
  - Look!
- - Come on.  Crawl faster.
  - DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
  - Sure.  Go left.
- - This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
  - Newt, wait!
- - I knew you'd come.
  - Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
- - Mommy...Mommy?
  - Right here, baby.  Right here.
- - Are we going to sleep now?
  - That's right.
  - Can we dream?
  - Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
- - And how are we today?
  - Terrible.
  - Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
  - How long have I been on Gateway station?
  - Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
- - Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
  - No.. I've slept enough.
- - You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium
    range, a couple days ago?
  - Yeah.  What?
  - There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something
    and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
  - Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference
    in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't
    ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always
    'don't ask.'
  - So what do I tell this guy?
  - Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
- - Sounds like you, Hicks.
  - The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then
    it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
- - Looks like it stung him.
  - Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
- - You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
  - Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
- - Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come
    in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get
    us, man, long before...
  - She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
- - This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
  - Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
- - Thanks.
  - Uh, what's next?
- - We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down
    on remote, somehow.
  - How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
  - I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
  - Think of what?  We're fucked.
  - What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why
    can't we use that?
- - Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal
    and go out there and plug in manually.
  - Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
- - They cut the power.
  - What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're
    animals.
- - This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement
    all over the place...
  - Just get back here!
- - Range twenty meters.
  - Seal the door.
- - Fifteen meters.
  - I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the
    plans. I don't know!
- - Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
  - They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
- - Nine meters.  Eight.
  - Can't be.  That's inside the room!
  - It's readin' right.  Look!
- - Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
  - No.  Have you?
- - Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
  - Fuck you.
  - Anytime.  Anywhere.
- - All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of
    CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
  - Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
- - Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
  - Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses
    kicked, pal!
- - Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna
    buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
  - Hudson, give us a break.
- - It's inside the complex.
  - You're just reading me.
  - No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
- - 'Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died
    during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.'
  - Poor bastard.
- - How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
  - About seventeen days.
- - All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote
    sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
  - We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
  - That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and
    seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two
    corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
- - They're in the approach corridor.
  - On my way.
- - Now many?
  - Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
- - Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
  - But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll
    take them awhile.
- - They'll get us.
  - Maybe.  Maybe not.
  - Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't
    you, it if comes to that?
  - If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like
    to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
- - What's this?
  - Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
  - Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
  - Yeah.  I've noticed.
- - Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
  - The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then
    he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
- - You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing
    each other over for a fucking percentage.
  - Let's waste him.  No offense.
- - It's game time.
  - Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
- - They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found
    another way in, something we missed.
  - We didn't miss anything.
- - Locked.
  - Stand back.
- - No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
  - All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
- - Hicks, don't let him leave.
  - We ain't going anywhere.
- - Ellen.
  - Don't be long, Ellen.
- - Save it.
  - Sure, Hicks.
- - Let's get the fuck out of here!
  - Not that tunnel, the other one!
- - Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we
    supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
  - Are you finished?  You okay?
- - Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like
    we got a purpose.
  - Aye-firmative.
- - We got problems.
  - I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
- - Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
  - I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but
    stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
- - The corner!  Ready?
  - Do it!
- - Seventeen meters.
  - Let's get these things lit.
- - Well you're not reading it right!
  - Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
- - Let's go!  Let's go!
  - Fuckin' A!
- - At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
  - Sir?
  - Yes, Hicks?
  - Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
  - What's the question?
  - Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
  - All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph
    may be involved.
- - Are there any questions?  Hudson?
  - How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
- - All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell
    us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks,
    meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
  - '...We''re coming in.'
  - He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
- - Sir, the CPU is on-line.
  - Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
- - Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
  - Alive?
  - Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel
    'C' under the south tower.
- - We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
  - You tell me.  I only work here.
- - How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
  - Thirty-eight...simulated.
- - Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
  - The structure seems intact.  They have power.
- - One of us?
  - Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
- - Where are your parents?  You have to try...
  - Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
- - What is it?
  - I don't know.
  - Proceed inside.
- - So.
  - So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
  - So?  So?
- - GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
  - Shut up.  Just shut up!
- - I told them to fall back...
  - They're but off!  Do something!
- - How do you feel?
  - All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
  - Forget it.
- - Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But
    if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
  - You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
  - These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art
    firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
  - We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
- - Still nothing from the colony?
  - Dead on all channels.
- - Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
  - It's insured.
- - What's he scanning for?
  - PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
- - We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
  - Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
- - Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
  - You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage
    team caught you when they...are you all right?
- - Have they located my daughter yet?
  - Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
- - Is she...?
  - 'Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of
    death.  Two years ago.  I''m sorry.'
- - Amy.
  - Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside
    Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
- - You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
  - Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You
    got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration,
    insurance company guys...
  - I get the picture.
  - Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
- - You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
  - They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head
    case.
  - You are a head case.  Have a donut.
- - No.  There's no way!
  - Hear me out...
  - I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go
    back out there?  Forget it.
- - What about you?  What's your interest in this?
  - Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration,
    against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building
    Better Worlds.'
- - Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
  - I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
  - That's right.
  - Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
  - It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off
    are worse.
  - What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company
    has agreed to pick up your contract?
  - If I go.
  - If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world
    for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
  - Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
- - Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare
    over and over...
  - No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
- - Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
  - Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not
    study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
  - That's the plan.  My word on it.
- - You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
  - Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on
    board.
- - I hope you're right.  I really do.
  - I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
- - That the atmosphere processor?
  - Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We
    manufacture them, by the way.
- - They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
  - Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
  - That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there,
    they'll rupture the cooling system.
  - She's right.
- - No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and
    nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
  - Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
  - Why not?
- - Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's
    move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value
    attached to it --
  - They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
  - This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily
    exterminate them --
  - Bullshit!
- - You son of a bitch.
  - Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
  - What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
  - Corporal Hicks!?
  - This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
- - Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're
    smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
  - You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of
    the Commerce Code.
  - You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know
    about it.
  - But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were
    responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
  - Now, wait a second --
  - You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates
    six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
- - You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn
    them?
  - Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security
    situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights,
    nothing.
- - I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
  - Sorry to disappoint you.
- - I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems
    to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
  - Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them
    over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
- - Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a
    hundred at least.
  - Yes.  That follows.
  - But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
  - That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect
    forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is
    ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
  - You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
  - Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's
    abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended
    by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives,
    quite literally the  mother of their society.
  - Could it be intelligent?
  - Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but
    she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy
    her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
- - That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
  - How long until it blows?
  - I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast
    radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
- - And it's too late to shut it down?
  - I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at
    this point.
- - I'll go.
  - What?
  - I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me,
    I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
  - All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
- - It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
  - See you soon.
- - HOW MUCH TIME?
  - PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
  - WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
- - Ripley...
  - She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
  - In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
- - You did okay, Bishop.
  - Well, thanks, I --
- - '...that''s better.  Pan it around a bit.'
  - Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
- - Okay, let's do it.
  - Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
- - Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on
    my 'clear,' then stay on station.
  - Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
- - First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
  - Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
- - Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
  - Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
- - Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and
    fall back by squads to the APC, over.
  - Say again?  All after incinerators?
- - This floor's freezing.
  - Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers,
    Hudson?
  - Would you, Sir?
- - Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
  - Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
- - Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
  - Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from
    virginity.
- - Movement!
  - Position?
  - Can't lock up...
  - Talk to me, Hudson.
  - Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
- - Hope their plumbing's the same.
  - It is.
- - How can I go?
  - Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your
    shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
  - What?
  - Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin
    up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol
    were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
  - Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
  - But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole
    thing.
  - Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the
    reception at Buddy's Burgers.
- - Does that look at all suspicious to you?
  - Whatever gave you that idea?
- - You got your vest?
  - Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
  - Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
- - Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
  - I got him.  Don't get pinned.
- - Get outta there!
  - I can't!  Do you mind!
  - I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
- - Yeah, Sykes?
  - Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
- - You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You
    know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
  - Departmental policy.
  - You?
- - Granger and Pitts are already on it.
  - Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with
    Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found
    over in the Newcomer community...
  - Don't tell me what to think.
- - You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
  - Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
- - Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you
    nailed outside by the car--
  - The human?
  - Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap
    sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance.
    Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
- - No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your
    buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
  - Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
- - You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
  - Yeah.
  - Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as...
    hearts.
  - Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
  - That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
- - Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting
    in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
  - Yeah, I'll bet.
- - You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
  - You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
- - What kind of test?
  - Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other
    day.
  - Did he find anything?
- - Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your
    name Porter?
  - Ss'kya'ta'.
  - What's that?
- - One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know
    him?
  - Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs
    a club on the west side.  Encounters.
  - Yeah, I heard of it.
  - That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
- - 'Here''s Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside,
    then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise:
    chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs
    waiting for that one at the refinery.'
  - Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
  - For you, anything.
- - 'Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga,
    California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise:
    organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.'
  - Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
  - I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
- - Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
  - Sure.  Just a minute.
- - Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm
    really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
  - Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
- - You think this is the guy who did it?
  - We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
  - To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda
    look alike to me.
  - Who else can I ask around here?
  - Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He
    isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
  - I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
- - That where Anderson worked?
  - Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these
    fellas do it.
- - Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've
    seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and
    show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
  - '... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.'
- - You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
  - What is it?
  - Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot
    loads.
  - Only holds five.
  - Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need
    but one.
  - No... two.
- - '... and we work my hours.  I''ll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta
    learn it so you might as well do it all.'
  - Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
  - What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals,
    we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're
    just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have
    to.
  - I am George.
- - Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys...
    Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little
    punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you.
    You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
  - My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
  - Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
- - Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
  - That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother
    you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean
    "excrement" and "cranium".
- - Let's talk Hubley.
  - His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near
    downtown.
  - With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
  - Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
  - Nice signal, dickwad!
- - Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they
    found him?  Was he ripped off?
  - There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
  - The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the
    till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us
    a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
  - The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
- - Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
  - Yes.
  - Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do
    for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set
    up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well,
    my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As
    my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
- - What is wrong?
  - Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's
    a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
- - Well... yes, quite possibly.
  - Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that...
    possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray
    of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
  - Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
  - Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
- - What's this?  What's going on?
  - Nothing.
  - Nothing?
  - Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
- - What is this?
  - A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put
    them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this
    for anything?
- - Get the picture?
  - And that fits?
  - Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
  - And still it fits?
- - Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their
    boots to protect against sparks.
  - How the hell do you know that?
  - A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes
    are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
  - So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley
    worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases
    just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to
    the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
  - I believe I should interview the widow alone.
  - Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
- - Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
  - Did you learn anything?
  - A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She
    identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
  - Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
  - She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
  - Did you talk to him?
  - He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
- - Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
  - We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
- - Why did you do it?
  - Why'd I do what?
  - Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have
    nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of
    detectives by making me your partner...
  - My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared
    into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing,
    nobody says nothing...
- - Who said that?
  - At the end of the bar.
- - Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
  - Uh, Matthew...
  - Back off, George.
  - But I-- .
  - I'll handle it.
- - Screw you.
  - Screw me?  That can't be right.
- - Tell me.
  - Your mother mates out of season.
  - That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be
    getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take
    this little session down to my office, ya know?
- - Matthew, you don't have to-- .
  - Stay back!  I'm okay.
- - You know that guy?
  - From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
  - How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
  - In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely
    random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
- - If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next
    time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect
    I think you were looking for.
  - Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
- - I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you
    to learn English?
  - Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were
    bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
- - Which one is that?  Raw what?
  - This is mole.  It's good.
  - I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a
    minute or two?
  - Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
- - So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
  - Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much
    in the translation.
  - And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
  - Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
  - Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
- - Who is he?
  - Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
- - We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
  - When will Strader return?
- - I believe he is probably lying.
  - Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want
    us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
- - So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
  - My wife?  She worries about me.
- - Yeah... I know the routine.
  - You are married?
  - Was.  Divorced.
  - We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
  - It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never
    really needed the damn thing in the first place.
- - Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when
    I walked in.
  - I appreciate your honesty, George.
- - Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You
    will be taking Sunday off, then...
  - Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out
    of a father there...
- - '... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where''d
    I leave the pen?"  You''re not... you don''t think that''s funny?  George, work
    with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor''s got the thermometer
    in his hand, then where''s his pen gotta be?'
  - In the other man's rectum.
  - Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like
    a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen
    stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
- - Your health...
  - Ta ss'trakyona'...
- - There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
  - No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
  - 'You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere
    of equality we''ve never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world,
    full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the
    first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by
    the rules... rules that aren''t made to keep one people subordinate to another,
    but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.'
- - I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you
    humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of
    you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
  - Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
- - I'm going home.
  - Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
- - Where'd you get this?!!
  - A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I
    must call my wife...
- - She's going to divorce me.
  - George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
  - She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
- - Well, let's roll, George.
  - To the... to the beach?
  - Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
- - Stop the car.
  - Why?
  - Please, I must get out here.
  - Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
  - Stop the car!
- - It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in
    a coupla minutes.
  - Thank you.
- - What was that about?
  - Nothing.
- - '... So we''ve got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way --
    execution style.'
  - Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated
    a successful bar and nightclub...
  - '... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell''s
    the connection?'
- - What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner
    to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's
    not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
  - You must leave me alone on this.
- - No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're
    gonna tell me now!
  - No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
  - The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn
    me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am
    I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
  - '... It is called ss''jabroka''.  To us it is a potent narcotic.'
  - How potent?
  - Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive
    small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
  - We?  You've taken it?
  - We all did.
  - Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
  - No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing
    it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully
    guarded.
  - Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
  - Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It
    would threaten our entire existence here.
- - George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
  - I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
- - They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry
    background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured
    it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution
    network.  And Harcourt--
  - Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
- - Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
  - If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
  - No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have
    the evidence, ya know?
- - Uh, George...
  - Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
- - George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
  - Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush
    your lungs against this wall.
- - George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got
    him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
  - The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
  - Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
- - ''
  - Fuck procedure.
- - Shit!
  - Ss-ai!
- - With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
  - It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a
    little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet
    guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your
    next two days as a detective.
- - What's this about, George?  I know that look.
  - There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
- - No!  We must do this alone.
  - Do what?!  George-- ?!
- - What is this?!
  - '... It''s Harcourt.'
  - Harcourt is dead.
  - No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a
    change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really
    a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
  - Tell me about it...
- - I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to
    wait for back-up.
  - We can't let him get away.
  - Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
  - Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
  - But there's no more drug.
  - You understand that.  But how many others will?
- - How do I look?
  - You look very good.
- - That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
  - This is becoming a serious breach of security.
  - He didn't recognize me.
  - It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
- - When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to
    question you about Hubley.
  - This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
- - Kill them both.
  - Here?
  - Do it!
- - William Harcourt?
  - Yes...
  - I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
  - Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of
    Detective yet.
- - Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
  - You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
  - That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen,
    I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment,
    I'm overdue at another function.
- - Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
  - No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
- - So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
  - Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
  - You don't have squat.
  - You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about
    as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
- - Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're
    not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
  - I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much
    surfin' you'd do.
- - Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
  - Lay off, asshole.
  - I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space
    thing.
- - You are Cassandra?
  - That's right.
  - We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
  - Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
- - He's not here.  Why ask me?
  - The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
  - She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
- - In there.
  - Show me.
- - Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could
    tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
  - Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
  - You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find
    pleasurable...
- - Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
  - The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe
    he knows.
  - Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
- - I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt,
    right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
  - Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
  - A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
- - There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't
    take it personally.
  - I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights
    go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But
    doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of
    it as broadening your horizons.
  - I like my horizons narrow.
  - Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah...
- - Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
  - Thank you.
- - Do you feel all right, sir?
  - Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
- - Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
  - No. No thank you.
- - Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
  - The cockpit? What is it?
  - It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's
    not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone
    with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about
    planes?
- - Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything
    about it.
  - Would you go up, please?
- - Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
  - Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
- - Excuse me, Sister?
  - Yes?
  - There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
  - Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
  - Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
  - Of course.
- - Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake
    to Lincoln.
  - Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
- - Roger.
  - Huh?
- - Roger.
  - Huh?
- - We have clearance, Clarence.
  - Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
- - Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
  - No, why don't you take care ot it?
- - No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
  - All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
- - Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
  - I will, but Jim won't.
- - Yes?
  - Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
  - 'Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what
    he had for dinner?'
  - Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
  - Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
- - Hi!
  - I'm Randy.
  - I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
  - I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
  - Oh, I'd love to.
  - Okay, this is one of my favorites.
- - Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for
    the Los Angeles Lakers!
  - I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger
    Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
- - You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
  - I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
- - I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind
    we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
  - I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
  - Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven-
    niner-niner.
  - '...and that lots of times you don''t even run down court.'
  - We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
  - '...and that you don''t really try, except during the playoffs.'
  - The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
- - Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on
    our flight to Chicago.
  - Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
- - What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
  - Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
- - Oh, I can't stand it.
  - What is it?
- - How ya doing, honey?
  - Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
  - Here.
- - And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been!
    Gunderson?
  - Yes, Captain?
  - Did you decide on a runway yet?
  - Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
- - Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
  - You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight
    niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
- - He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an
    asshole!
  - Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've
    got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we
    get a break in the weather.
- - He's right on the heading.
  - All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
- - Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
  - You promise you'll write.
  - Every day.
- - Good-bye, darling.
  - Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
  - So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
  - Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
  - Good-bye, darling.
  - Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
  - Good-bye, darling.
- - We have a visitor.
  - Hello.
- - We'd better get back now.
  - Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
- - Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
  - Who wants to be first?
- - Airsick?
  - I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
  - Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
- - Elaine!
  - Ted!
  - I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later.
    Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
  - I just don't want to go over it any more.
  - I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll
    just be patient, I can work things out.
  - I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
  - Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
  - It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I
    can't live with a man I don't respect!
- - Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
  - I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
  - Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
  - Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
- - You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if
    I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
  - Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone
    else it's ancient history.
  - You expect me to believe that?
- - It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different
    cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
  - But if you'll just give me...
  - It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all
    over again. I'm sorry.
- - Ted, what are you doing here?
  - Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
  - You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
- - What's the matter?
  - My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very
    important mission.
  - Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
  - I love you, Elaine.
  - I love you.
- - Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But
    it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
  - I remember everything. All I have are memories.
- - Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used
    to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards
    how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each
    new day was created...only for us.
  - That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
  - But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
- - You got a telegram from headquarters today.
  - Headquarters!? What is it?
  - It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now.
    They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good
    news?
- - Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
  - Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out
    in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
- - I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
  - Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
- - What's his problem?
  - That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
- - I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
  - Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans
    we made before the war.
  - A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
- - Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
  - That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
- - Rain.
  - And a little ice.
  - And a little ice!
- - Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
  - Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
- - It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
  - It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
- - Rats! I've lost number three.
  - What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
  - Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this,
    the shit's gonna hit the fan.
- - But Ted, you're the only...
  - I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone
    who'd never flown before.
- - Ted...
  - Yes?
  - I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
  - Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
  - The gear is down.
- - See them, Elaine?
  - Uh-huh.
- - Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
  - That's right.
  - We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
  - Yes. Yes, of course.
- - You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman
    has to be gotten to a hospital.
  - A hospital? What is it?
  - It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the
    Captain I must speak to him.
  - Certainly.
- - What was it we had for dinner tonight?
  - Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
  - Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
- - What did he have?
  - He had fish.
- - Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases,
    and they ate fish, too.
  - Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
  - He had fish, too.
- - Just how serious is it, doctor?
  - Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
- - Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
  - No.
  - All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even
    be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land
    this plane?
  - Well...
- - No. No one that I know of.
  - 'I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board
    depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this
    plane, but who didn''t have fish for dinner.'
- - Captain, how soon can we land?
  - I can't tell.
- - Can't you take a guess?
  - Well...not for another two hours.
  - You can't take a guess for another two hours?
  - No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything
    this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
- - What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
  - I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film
    Festival.
- - Both pilots!
  - Can you fly this airplane and land it?
  - Surely you can't be serious.
  - I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you
    had?
  - Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four
    engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
- - Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of
    us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope
    we've got.
  - Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing
    lights.
- - '...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.'
  - Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
- - Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
  - Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
  - I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
  - Surely there must be something you can do.
  - I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
- - George Zipp said that?
  - And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up
    against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with
    all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then,
    Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
  - Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
- - Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
  - Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
- - Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
  - Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details.
    Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
  - Something about a plane with no pilot?
- - Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very
    much.
  - Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
- - '...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.'
  - Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
- - I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
  - That's very nice of you. Thank you.
- - Ah, won't you sit down?
  - Thank you. Cream?
  - No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
  - Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
  - Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City
    school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are
    you from L.A.?
  - No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
- - After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with
    one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as
    part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially
    and I couldn't function in business.
  - Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
  - But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't
    you ever married?
  - Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
  - I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your
    work, you didn't have time for marriage.
  - I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of
    the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
  - You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business
    and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
  - Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
  - That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me
    'Bubbles.'
- - I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message
    you'd like me to give someone?
  - No. I'm all alone.
  - Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't
    spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
  - That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same
    for me.
- - Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can
    I be of some help?
  - Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
  - You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
  - Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
  - Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
  - I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
  - You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
- - You've been hurt.
  - I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
  - No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
- - Do you want to talk about it.
  - I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
  - No.  I mean your relationship.
  - We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
  - Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
  - People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
  - Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
  - Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
  - Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's
    change in the two people who share that love.
  - I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when
    you laugh all the time.
- - No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
  - Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
- - Are you on the Mercury mission?
  - That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
- - You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
  - Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
  - You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
  - I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
- - Striker.
  - Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
  - That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
  - Then Elaine was right.
  - Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
  - Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
- - I have to see Bud Kruger.
  - Do you have an appointment, sir?
  - No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
  - You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
  - All right, it's a matter of death.
  - Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
- - You can't go in there!
  - Don't try to stop me!
  - But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
- - You folks need any help?
  - Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
  - Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
  - Yes.
  - It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
  - Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
  - Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
  - Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
- - Captain Oveur?
  - Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
  - We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
- - That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive
    system of amphibians.
  - Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
- - Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
  - Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
- - Whenever your're ready, Captain.
  - Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and
    ready for count-down.
- - Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
  - Sixteen 'C', why?
  - He's carrying a bomb.
  - A b...
- - No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers
    into the lounge.
  - What should I say?
  - Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
- - A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
  - How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
  - No.  Poached.  Over.
  - Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
  - Just poached on toast.  Over.
- - That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
  - All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
  - Poached!  Not over!  Over!
- - Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
  - Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
- - Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
  - I don't want to live anymore.
  - Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance,
    not life insurance.
  - What?
  - That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's
    wrong with you.
  - You're sure?
  - I'm sure.
- - Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get
    there.
  - We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned
    your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
  - Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
  - I don't want to hear that word!
  - Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the
    best sex clinic in the country.
  - All right.  Here.
  - What...?
- - Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
  - Scraps.
  - Can I hold him?
  - Sure.
  - He's a boy dog.
  - Yeah.
  - Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
- - Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
  - We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
- - I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
  - I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
  - Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
  - It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
- - How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
  - No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
  - Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're
    all asking for it all the time!!
- - Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
  - Negative.
  - That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
  - Negative.
  - That's not possible.
  - Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
- - Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
  - That's okay, ROK.
  - Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
  - Go ahead.
  - You have great tits.
- - Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
  - Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
  - Request; life support systems check.
  - Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman.
    I can relate to that.
  - Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral
    changes.
  - There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We
    can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven
    <u>that</u>.
- - Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us
    a problem with our communications.
  - Yes, sir.
- - I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
  - I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
  - We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory
    system.
- - Roger.
  - You can do it from up here, Captain.
  - I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
  - No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
  - Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
- - For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
  - Simon.
  - Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago
    run.
  - And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very
    lucky woman.
- - Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after
    the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
  - But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division
    for the Jupiter probe.
  - You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
- - Frank's the best pilot in the program.
  - I'm so excited, Simon.
  - I guess this is a first for you.
  - No, I've been excited before.
- - Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior
    does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
  - Simon, why has he become so... so...
  - So mentally ill?
- - Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
  - Don't be too long.
- - Have you got it straightened out now?
  - I think so.
  - That's my girl.
- - Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
  - Roger.
- - Simon, what's happening?!
  - He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship
    and we're heading right for the sun.
  - Can't we change course?
  - We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
- - My career is shot.
  - Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened
    to the man I thought I loved?
- - Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
  - Maybe.
  - Simon, what are you saying?!
- - Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
  - The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next
    to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area,
    this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
- - So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's
    sick.
  - What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
- - You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
  - I mean for Ted.
  - You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions
    here in the garden.
  - Is that a good sign, Doctor?
- - The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
  - Is he making any progress, Doctor?
  - Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
- - Elaine.
  - Te...!
  - That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
- - It's got to be stopped!
  - But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
  - I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
- - Ted, what's wrong?
  - Ask Simon.
- - Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
  - There's nothing wrong with me!
  - Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just
    the way you like it, with spaghetti.
  - You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's
    all here!
- - Elaine.
  - Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
- - Elaine, what happened to us?
  - Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's
    a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his
    faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in
    a man.
- - Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
  - Who's that, Ted?
  - Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
- - Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out
    of the way.
  - And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important
    thing right now.
- - His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
  - Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity
    is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back
    at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
- - No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
  - If that's the way you want it.
  - That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
  - Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
- - Ted!  What are you...?
  - I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
- - Ted, we're taking off!
  - Let me by, Elaine.
- - What are you doing, Ted?
  - I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
- - Ted.
  - Not now, Elaine!
  - Ted!
- - Elaine.
  - Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying
    to prove.
  - Elaine, we have to go back.
  - We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
  - Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed
    FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
- - Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
  - Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
  - I've never used the word insane, Ted.
  - What word would you use, Elaine?
  - The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
  - What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
  - I'd use the word insane.
  - There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring.
    That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
  - Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
- - Elaine!
  - Ted!
  - Elaine, what's going on?
  - Ted, there's no time to explain.
- - Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this
    hunk of tin as best you can.
  - Ted, please be careful.
- - Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
  - Not now, Elaine.
  - I mean until we start to burn up.
- - Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew
    this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger,
    and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
  - That was very well put, Ted.
- - Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
  - I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
  - That might be the news we've been waiting for.
- - Simon just ejected!
  - Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was
    a fool to eject now.
  - You mean...
  - That's right -- premature ejection.
  - What will happen to him, Ted?
  - The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast
    like a pig on a spit.
- - Are you afraid?
  - Not when I'm with you, Ted.
  - I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
- - We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
  - Set!
  - Now!
  - Compute!
- - Ted, the lever!
  - Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
- - Oveur.
  - Dunn.
- - Shut down accelerators.
  - Accelerators down.
- - We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
  - You better check it, Unger.
- - Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
  - You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
- - Dunn.
  - Sir?
  - You better take this.
- - Did you feel that?
  - Yes I did...
  - Felt like a large asteroid.
  - Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
  - What is it, Mary?
  - Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
- - Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch
    testing.
  - Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
- - And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u>
    talk to them.
  - Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot
    of pressure from the boys downtown.
- - You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys
    in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
  - Commissioner.
- - What?
  - I just wish it was that simple.
- - That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
  - That just doesn't make any sense.
  - I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
  - I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
  - You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle
    that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want
    him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
- - Forget it.  I was reading.
  - I was reading too.
  - What's the story?
  - Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
  - I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
- - Kruger, Sagittarius.
  - Commissioner, Aquarius.
- - '*                     CBS said they''ll give us four minutes.  They thought the
    Russian was a nice touch.'
  - I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
- - You wanna knock of f?
  - No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
  - He and the NRA don't like the wording.
- - With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers
    are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
  - I might still have a few chips left.
  - '*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The
    second amendment types''ll love that.'
  - This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides,
    Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
  - Other way around, sir.
  - Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
- - It's bait.  Don't take it.
  - Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You
    can't afford to leave that hanging.
  - Did we tape the Duke game?
- - I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
  - We'll just say it was in bad taste.
- - You give me ulcers.
  - That's my job.
- - Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review
    the Iraq situation.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
  - Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
- - Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
  - I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
- - Shepherd.
  - Sir...
- - My god. I think that was a MiG.
  - A MiG? Where the hell are we?
- - Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
  - Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
- - Shit.
  - How long's it been since you flew, sir?
  - Twenty-five years.
- - Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
  - They better. Fuel's almost gone.
- - IT'S OPEN!
  - DO YOU SEE TEEM?
- - WE'RE HOOKED!
  - We're hooked. Hove into position.
- - White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
  - Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's
    there? Is the Vice- President there?
  - who can I say is calling?
  - This is the President.
  - Yeah, right.
  - Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
  - Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get
    a life, before I have this call traced.
  - You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
- - Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
  - Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
  - Thank you for calling the white House...
  - No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
- - What's going on?
  - We're under attack.
  - Where's my family?
  - We're handling it, sir.
- - One.
  - But...
  - Two... THREE. GO!
- - Did they say anything about my family?
  - They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty
    minutes.
  - Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
- - and if that means negotiating...
  - You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of
    America becomes a target.
  - But this is different, sir. You're the President.
- - Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
  - Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with
    that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office
    of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We
    don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
- - The fax machines.
  - Excuse me?
  - The fax machines.
  - No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
  - No. I thought about this, Mr.
- - Where are we sending it?
  - White House Situation room.
- - Someone should give you a raise.
  - Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
- - May I speak to you for a moment?
  - Can't it wait?
  - No, Mr. President.  It can't.
- - Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
  - Rose, I don't have time for this.
- - For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even
    you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing
    too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
  - She's a big girl.  She understands.
  - How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with
    her, or me, in weeks.
  - And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already
    three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to
    fuck off because I'm a family man?
- - You know what?
  - What?
  - I miss you. And I miss her.
  - But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
  - I wish it were that easy...
- - I'll make it up to you, I promise.
  - I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for
    that middle class tax cut.
  - This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
- - How did your speech go?
  - Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
- - Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
  - Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
- - I don't know why you stayed.
  - Please... don't start with me.
- - Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
  - Both of you.
- - What are you doing?
  - Flying the plane.
  - You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
- - Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization
    of two mechanized brigades.
  - They've gotta be joking.
- - The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our
    Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
  - Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
- - Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from
    here to there?
  - Gravity.
- - We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
  - We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out -
    tell the refueling plane...
  - They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives.
    My only solution ran out of batteries.
- - Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
  - Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
  - Got it.
- - I'll not going without my family.
  - Yes, sir.
- - Sir, we stay with the President.
  - That isn't necessary.
- - Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied
    while they're in the air.
  - Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off
    the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in
    20 minutes.
  - Twenty minutes?
  - You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
- - Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper,
    waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
  - Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
- - Finally, we can bargain.
  - I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade
    you hostages for fuel.
- - Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate,
    I wondered if you would be so kind.
  - Over my dead body.
  - No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start
    with your family instead... Gibbs.
- - She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
  - Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
- - This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
  - Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
- - Stop.
  - You'll do it?
  - Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
  - Good. Good.
- - Someday, you'll regret my nature.
  - You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics,
    however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long
    before you were a hostage to
- - The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
  - One thing I've learned as
- - There goes your ride.
  - Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
  - If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
- - No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
  - Hold on, Alice.
- - Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish,
    and bound to die.
  - What do you want with us?
  - Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and
    a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
- - Now, or he dies, please.
  - Come on, Alice.
- - Leave my daughter alone.
  - Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband,
    on the other hand...
  - What do you know of my husband?
  - I know he left you behind.
  - My husband is a very courageous man.
  - Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal
    a man from his home in the middle of the night.
- - Do you have to be so brutal?
  - 'Yes'
  - Why? Do you enjoy it?
  - I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
  - How can you? I mean they're people.
- - But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me
    this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those
    dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see?
    Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they
    were not your people.
  - That was war.
  - So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
- - Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
  - No.
  - Say something dear.
- - Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
  - You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
- - The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
  - Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
- - Four...
  - Jim...
  - Three...
- - You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
  - You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
- - Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
  - The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're
    all cleared?  You can follow me then.
- - Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The
    MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're
    linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We
    could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
  - This is a remarkable aircraft.
  - You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from
    radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
  - A dubious distinction, no?
  - I guess it depends on your perspective.
- - And all these rooms here?
  - Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles
    as an emergency medical center.
- - Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne
    I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
  - Thank you.
- - '*                     Please tell me your name.'
  - Maria... Maria Mitchell.
  - And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
- - I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
  - How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
  - Scared. We're scared.
- - You're pointing a gun at me.
  - Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
- - Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
  - Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against
    the Presidential Seal.
- - Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
  - Stand by.
  - Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
- - We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
  - Tower, here.
  - This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo
    Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe
    onboard.
  - Copy, Air Force One.
- - We've already been inspected.
  - Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
- - The rest of the secret service?
  - Dead.
  - How many others killed?
  - Nine.
  - Any of us?
- - Who did this?
  - We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
  - A secret service agent. It must be.
- - Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
  - why did they do that?
  - Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
  - Well it worked.
- - How?
  - Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast
    Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
  - Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
- - We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
  - We're not going to make it.
  - Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
  - Where are we now?
  - Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
  - No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans
    built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels
    in mid-air. Call the White House.
- - Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
  - About goddamn time.
  - Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
  - Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
- - Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
  - Roger.
- - That's affirmative.
  - Ga get it.
- - Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
  - Yes, Mr. President.
  - Why?
  - Because it is my duty.
  - You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
  - My loyalty was never to my country.
- - General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
  - Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
- - Can we do that?
  - We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
- - But they start executing hostages in
  - I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take
    them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
  - Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty
    Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
- - They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called.
    What do you think it means?
  - Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards
    to play and which to discard.
- - If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
  - Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're
    spying.
  - If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
- - The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
  - To swear you in as President.
- - Sir, you threw out page two.
  - Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic
    bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
  - It was a good ad-lib, sir.
  - Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
- - Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought
    it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
  - Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
- - The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
  - An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
- - He's dead then. They must have killed him.
  - We don't know that.
  - Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're
    making demands.
- - Walter, if you have a point, make it.
  - That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
- - They aren't answering their hails.
  - This doesn't make sense.
- - They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing
    and they're losing fuel.
  - I prefered the terrorists.
  - That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
- - U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
  - Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
- - Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck
    out of here.
  - You read my mind.
  - Put your pilot on.
  - He's busy being dead.
- - Who's flying the fucking plane?
  - I'm doing what I can.
- - Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
  - Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
  - Got it.
  - Stay cool.
- - How we doing, Colonel?
  - We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
- - Uh, we got a problem here.
  - Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
  - No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
  - Lemme take a look.
- - Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
  - Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
  - Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
- - Do you see the maintenance panel?
  - Got it.
  - Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
  - Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
  - Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump.
    There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should
    be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
- - It's cut.
  - cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
- - The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they
    are surrounding a 747.
  - Did we warn them off?
  - Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
- - It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
  - They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
  - The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
- - The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
  - Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
- - Oooooh, I'm good.
  - Hey, you guys back already?
- - How was...  ...the ballet?
  - It was the experience of a lifetime.
  - How `bout a hug for the old man.
- - Alice!
  - Daddy...
- - Daddy...
  - Alice... I...
- - How you doing, sweetie?
  - Been better, Dad... You?
- - Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
  - It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
- - There they are!
  - Okay, I'm slowing us down.
- - I don't drink coffee.
  - You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
  - No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
- - You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
  - So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
  - Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered
    in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw
    I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
  - Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word
    &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
  - Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
- - The woman you shot. She was my friend.
  - That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
- - Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
  - It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
- - He didn't leave us.
  - You are a resilient man, Mr.
- - It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
  - Well, you aren't the President, dear.
  - Yeah, no duh.
- - You don't want to say hi to your father?
  - I'm sure he's busy.
  - Don't you even want to ask?
- - Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
  - Alice...
  - Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
  - You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
  - Back at The Fishbowl?
- - We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls
    seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
  - I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
- - He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
  - I'm sorry, honey.
  - No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
- - When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard
    Air Force One.
  - Your father never means to be so...
  - I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at
    school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it
    doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
  - Some kids were teasing you?
  - That's not really the point.
- - You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
  - Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
- - Mom?
  - Yes dear?
  - I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
- - Daddy. Daddy, please...
  - Jim... for godsake!
- - Rolfe.
  - Wade?
  - Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston
    about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
  - There was something. It happened up your way.
  - Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt.
    He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
  - Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We
    got different habits.
  - No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're
    supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he
    didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
- - It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
  - He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New
    England and the construction business.
  - Who?
  - Twombley.
  - No shit.
  - You think Jack shot him?
  - Well, it was an accident.
  - They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came
    back and found the body.
- - Lillian was here. In Lawford.
  - Huh?
  - The night before the shooting.
  - How was she?
  - Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted
    to go home.
  - Who?
  - Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
  - What happened?
  - A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
- - Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
  - Yeah, I guess.
  - Get some sleep.
  - I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going
    to bite back. I swear it.
  - Haven't you already done a bit of that?
  - No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
- - Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
  - What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
- - Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
  - No thanks. I don't drink.
  - Yeah. I forgot.
- - What about Margie?
  - What about her?
  - Well, do you still plan to get married?
  - Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave
    him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll
    be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department,
    by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All
    hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
- - I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's
    always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
  - Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
  - I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
  - Want to know what I think happened?
- - Find them everywhere.
  - I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
  - Which is?
  - That it wasn't an accident.
  - Then who shot him?
  - Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
  - Motive. You gotta have a motive.
  - Money.
  - Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
  - They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly
    dead?
  - I don't know. You tell me.
  - Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify.
    They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be
    the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
  - Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
  - Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts
    nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law
    is involved.
  - So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper.
    He wants an accident.
  - A hunting accident is perfect.
  - Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident,
    you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying
    the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license
    pulled.
- - It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay
    to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that
    piss you off?
  - Not particularly.
  - Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
  - I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
- - I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood
    out of the ice and after.
  - Yeah.
  - I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
  - Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
  - It may have happened, but not the way you said.
  - You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
  - It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it
    was about Elbourne.
  - We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
  - And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay
    loft.
  - Well, I never heard that one.
  - I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was
    a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted
    by that man's violence.
  - That's what you think.
- - Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't
    know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man,
    I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like
    that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being
    so upset -- one thing on top of another.
  - Wade, are you alright?
  - But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit
    LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
- - I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
  - For what?
- - To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons.
    That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
  - Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from
    taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist,
    for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts
    straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
- - Rolfe.
  - A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn
    off that TV!
- - Just do it.
  - Atta-go.
- - What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
  - Nothing.
  - You no-good pup!
- - Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
  - Sleeping.
  - You remember Margie Fogg?
  - From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
  - How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
  - We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
  - Yeah.
- - Where's Ma?
  - She's coming.
- - Yeah.
  - I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as
    me. Which is why I give her the heater.
  - Is there something wrong with the phone?
  - In the living room.
  - Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
  - Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
- - Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
  - Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you
    is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
- - Pop, for Christ's sake!
  - You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
- - You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you.
    You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
  - You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
  - Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right.
    I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
- - Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
  - Love! I'm made of love!
  - Call it what you want.
  - Everything you know is from me.
  - Yeah.
  - Bang!
  - You and me.
- - Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where
    it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
  - Crawl!
  - Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money,
    my truck -- stolen!
  - I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
- - Take care, Wade.
  - You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
- - It don't look right.
  - What?
  - The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
  - Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering.
    Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with
    it.
  - I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real
    modern too.
  - This town sucks.
  - Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking",
    that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
- - Marg!
  - That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this.
    I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty
    and I know the difference. This is different.
  - Marg! You got orders!
- - You talked to Jack?
  - Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
  - The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose.
    I assume accidental.
  - Jack?
  - The other guy.
  - Where... how'd you hear that?
  - CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling
    for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy
    kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
  - No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts.
    Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
- - Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
  - It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
- - Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to
    clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
  - His office. You mean my old office.
  - Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
  - He got his deer yet?
  - No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were
    you. He's real pissed.
- - Who are you?
  - I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
  - He's asleep. We were up very late.
  - Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
  - Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
  - Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon.
    I'm the local police officer.
  - Something about my father?
  - Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
  - Can't it wait, then?
- - Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
  - How's that?
- - I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
  - Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons,
    I don't call ahead for an appointment.
  - What the hell are you talking about?
  - I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
  - Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me
    a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
  - Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights,
    then you--
  - Hold on!
  - Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
  - You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school
    where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic
    cop or something?
  - Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
  - Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
  - Yes. Here's your ticket.
  - You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going
    to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can
    do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
- - Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
  - There's a furnace.
  - You're not using it today?
  - It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
  - Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do
    that?
- - Coffee's perked.
  - When did she die?
  - Is...? She's dead then?
- - It makes me sad.
  - Can --?
  - Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
- - New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
  - For a while.
  - How's she doing?
  - Okay. She's fine.
  - You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay?
    I'm off.
- - Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
  - See you tomorrow, maybe.
  - You okay?
  - Yeah.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah.
  - I'm sorry about what I said.
  - Said what?
  - About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
  - Forget it.
  - I'm sorry.
  - I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You
    know?
- - You don't mean that.
  - Yeah. I mean that.
  - No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days
    then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how
    you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
  - The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day
    I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing,
    this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she
    owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
- - Call me.
  - Tonight. Let's get together.
  - Okay.
- - Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few
    weeks.
  - There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
  - I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove
    off without her...
  - I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
  - '...Jack''s turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to
    be a sweet kid, but it''s like, when he found out he couldn''t play ball anymore,
    he changed. Now he''s like everyone else.'
  - I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting
    himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
  - Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot
    Twombley on purpose?
- - Money.
  - Jack doesn't need money.
  - Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law
    of his. People like that.
  - Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
  - Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots
    of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links
    with the Mafia.
  - The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
  - No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that
    kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
  - You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
  - No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty
    fucked up, you know.
  - But not now.
- - I can see what you looked like as a kid.
  - You knew me as a kid.
  - Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face,
    like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now,
    this way.
  - What way?
  - After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
  - It's nice.
- - Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing
    -- just now?
  - I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may
    be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes
    a big fight.
  - Then... I guess you have to.
  - There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about
    the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking
    lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
  - Oh, Wade.
  - I've been thinking about it, that's all.
  - You've been married twice --
  - It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal
    or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think
    about. You know?
  - Alright. I'll think about it.
  - Good.
- - Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
  - Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
  - I know your parents.
  - I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
- - Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
  - The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
- - Strange.
  - Think they're alright?
  - Of course! I would've heard.
  - How?
  - I don't know for Christ's sake!
- - This is nuts.
  - Wade.
- - What happened?
  - Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
- - What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
  - It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
  - I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
  - Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the
    next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
- - Going somewhere, Margie?
  - I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale.
    And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
  - Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
  - Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
- - Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
  - Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
  - Did you get his number?
  - I know who it is.
  - Good. Who?
  - Mel Gordon.
  - I still don't understand --
  - From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're
    headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt,
    so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
- - Lillian!
  - Where's Jill?
- - Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from
    not knowing some of the new kids --
  - Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
- - While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there,
    with whatzizname?
  - Yeah.
  - She's grown up some, hasn't she?
  - Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already,
    so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
- - I don't want her to go, Lillian.
  - Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
  - I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out.
    It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe
    it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic
    victim or something?
- - You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
  - No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
  - We should talk.
  - We've done all our talking, Wade.
  - It's just...
  - Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how
    much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned
    off -- and then they're gone.
- - Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
  - Yeah, lots.
  - See. Get your boots.
  - Hi honey.
- - No problem. Look, I...
  - You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
  - Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
  - You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child
    you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
- - We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative!
    And the best costume of all!
  - Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
- - Tomorrow, Gordon.
  - Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
- - Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
  - Where's the plow?
  - Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
  - His son-in-law damn near killed me.
  - Huh?
  - At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his
    ass.
  - Don't go playing policeman.
  - What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
  - You don't want the extra police pay?
  - I'm not saying that.
  - Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't
    belong here. That's why she left.
  - Fuck you.
  - That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
- - What's the hurry?
  - A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
  - Huh?
  - I figured you already heard.
  - 'Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know?
    C''mon, you drive. We''ll take my truck.'
- - Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
  - Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
  - Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
  - You mean Twombley?
  - Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
- - He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually
    happens.
  - I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
  - I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that
    fucking grader.
  - You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
  - Like hell.
- - That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
  - You want me to follow them to Littleton?
  - Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking
    better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
- - What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with
    Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
  - It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
  - Something bugging you?
  - Yeah. A few things.
  - Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you
    can get bugged on your own time.
- - How you holding up, Wade?
  - I'm fine, fine.
  - You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
- - Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
  - You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
  - On what you pay me?
  - Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
- - What do I have to do for it?
  - Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here
    and it's time we changed things a little.
  - I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
  - So?
  - He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept
    it.
  - Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself.
    Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
  - You? Why?
  - Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business
    with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
  - That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
  - What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon.
    Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
  - Want to buy?
  - Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
  - I won't. You interested?
  - Maybe.
  - You and Mel Gordon?
  - Could be.
  - Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell
    cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
- - Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
  - You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack,
    don't you see that?
  - The key, Wade.
  - Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these
    years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack?
    All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've
    got to call my brother.
- - I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating
    now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were
    hungry, remember.
  - Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
  - Yeah.
  - Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
- - Those are the Hoyts.
  - I don't care. They're out.
  - Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's
    too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving
    cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes.
    Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
- - Why do they do that?
  - Do what?
  - You know.
  - Break stuff?
  - Yeah. It's stupid.
  - I guess they're stupid.
  - Did you do that when you were a kid?
  - Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers.
    It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
  - Was it funny?
  - To us it was.
  - But it's not funny now.
  - It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people
    make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
  - I bet you did lots of bad things.
  - What are you talking about?
  - I just think you used to be bad.
  - No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
  - No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
- - Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
  - I don't want to.
  - Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't
    been that long.
  - It's not that.
  - What then?
  - It's stupid.
  - It's fun.
  - I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
  - Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been
    messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy
    as a goddamned clam.
- - Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke.
    You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from
    school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging
    out with me all day.
  - No.
  - No what?
  - No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow.
    I want to go home.
  - You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
  - I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go
    home.
  - Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home,
    I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
  - I called Mommy.
  - What? You called Mommy? Just now?
  - Yes.
  - Jesus, why?
  - I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
  - Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk
    to me about it first?
  - See, I knew you'd be mad.
  - Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
  - I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
  - Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's
    sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon,
    we're gonna call her before she leaves.
- - She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
  - Yes.
  - That's all you got to say? "Yes".
  - Yes.
  - She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
  - Yes.
  - Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids
    isn't good enough.
- - Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine
    with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
  - That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
- - Dad.
  - I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
- - Are we going in this?
  - Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
  - It's pretty old.
  - It belongs to Pop.
  - Pop?
  - Grandpa. My father. It's his.
  - Oh.
- - How about a Big Mac?
  - Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
  - C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What
    do you say?
  - No.
  - What do you want, then?
  - Nothing.
  - You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
  - Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
  - I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
  - Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
- - Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's
    for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
  - Okay.
  - Fine.
- - Please don't cry. Please, honey.
  - What are you sorry for?
  - I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak
    a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
  - I want to go home.
  - You can't.
- - That's illegal, you know.
  - I know.
  - You're a policeman.
  - Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
  - Oh.
- - Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
  - I want to go home.
  - Okay, let's go home, then.
- - Don't mind if I do.
  - LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
  - Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
- - No brag. Just fact.
  - Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
- - I thought I told you to move that truck!
  - Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
  - You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you
    smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be
    outta a job.
  - Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems,
    but everybody's got problems.
  - Not here.
- - Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt
    for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
  - Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
  - Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100
    a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster
    bucks hiding out up there.
  - How'd you get the job?
  - Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm
    his boy.
- - Like you and Gordon?
  - Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
  - Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
  - Right!
- - Bastard's got his high beams on.
  - Shit.
- - Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got
    to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back
    to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
  - Piece of fucking cake.
- - Where'd Twombley get shot?
  - In the chest.
  - No, I mean whereabouts.
  - A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
  - You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
  - The ambulance guys lugged him up.
  - You stayed away?
  - Yeah.
  - Where'd you get the blood?
  - What blood?
  - On your sleeve.
  - Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
  - I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd
    he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
  - Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
  - I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
  - Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
  - Sure you did.
  - What?
  - Saw him do it?
  - What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you
    that.
  - You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
  - Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
- - There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing
    me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably
    fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess
    you deserve it. Right's right.
  - Yeah.
  - Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
  - He sure as hell won't.
- - I'm fucking out of here.
  - Lawford?
  - Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
- - Open the door, will ya?
  - Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
  - Open the door. We're late.
  - I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack,
    and you're digging wells in the snow.
  - What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
- - It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
  - Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow
    or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
  - Guaranteed, eh?
  - Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are
    right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before
    ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you
    inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what
    you're paying me for, ain't it?
  - Damn straight!
- - Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
  - Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred
    bucks in it.
  - If you get it?
  - Yeah.
  - You might not kill it.
  - You think so.
  - You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't
    guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
  - You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
  - Mmm.
  - You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
  - I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll
    have him by coffee time.
  - And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
  - Wonderful!
- - I'm okay.
  - Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
- - I used to play ball.
  - Yeah?
  - Drafted by the Red Sox.
  - You played for the Sox?
  - Double A. New Britain.
  - Oh.
  - Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
  - Really.
  - They said.
  - Hmm.
  - The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
  - What happened?
  - Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm,
    I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
- - Safety on?
  - Yeah.
  - This way.
  - Sun's gettin high.
  - Deers have ears too.
- - Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle
    around.
  - You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
- - You heard the news.
  - I hear Twombley got shot.
  - Yeah.
- - You see it?
  - Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun
    go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for
    a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
  - This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter
    are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
- - Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've
    been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
  - Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
  - You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big
    deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't
    comment.
  - Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
  - No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
- - He's on to us!
  - Shit! What are we gonna do?
  - Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
  - You can't buy Wade off.
  - We bought you.
  - That was me.
- - I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like
    me. I just want to be a good father.
  - It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
  - I plan to. Soon.
  - How soon?
  - This spring.
  - Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your
    ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
  - It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
  - No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn.
    Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
  - Yes.
  - Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
  - Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
  - Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could
    drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want
    to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it
    wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
  - Oh.
  - You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
  - Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not
    as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five
    hundred.
- - What are you boys up to?
  - Same old shit.
- - The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
  - Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
  - -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through
    the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
  - Yeah. I know about that.
  - LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred
    for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
  - Tell me.
  - Chub says you're fired.
  - He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
  - He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean
    out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car.
    They're town property.
- - You got yourself a computer, Alma.
  - Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
  - No. Black.
- - Are you alright, Wade?
  - Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like
    everybody else. But I'm okay.
  - Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother.
    It was a nice funeral.
  - Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
  - Always has been.
  - This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking
    about murder. Among other things.
  - Who?
  - Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
  - Who?
  - You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
- - '...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he''s my age.'
  - Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
  - You don't believe me?
  - About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
  - I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance
    comes in.
  - Has anybody offered to buy it?
  - As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
- - This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
  - What is the Northcountry Development Association?
  - I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president
    and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade.
    $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
  - Twombley involved?
  - No.
  - He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
  - All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using
    his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
- - My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
  - Thank you.
- - See what?
  - The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles
    from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete
    circle...
- - Well, I'll be - !
  - I'll be another!
- - Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes'
    were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
  - Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
- - You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u>
    goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
  - Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
- - We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
  - But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
- - Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
  - Toward the Pole!
- - Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
  - All right - go to it.
- - Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
  - Come where?
- - That's a <u>face</u>???
  - Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear
    to you.
  - 'Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn''t?'
- - My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable
    for colonization -
  - '- for horrors like yourself?'
- - Swell!
  - Your friend was to remain where he was!
- - He did!
  - I am afraid not.  Therefore -
- - Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
  - On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
  - Why?
  - I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for
    study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate
    in our 'earth-colonizers.'
- - It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately
    'heals' itself.
  - That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
  - Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
- - To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
  - Obviously.
  - <u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
- - Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
  - I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt,
    and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
  - I met Dr. Kent, once.
- - I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters,
    this trip.
  - Who with?
  - Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
- - '''Doctor'' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?'
  - Huh?
  - It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
- - What do you think?
  - I think I should have joined the Air Force!
- - Determine extent of damage, immediately.
  - 'After torpedo room:  Report!'
- - You're sure it's Cyclops?
  - Take a look.
- - What's the running time?
  - Thirty-four seconds!
- - Right <u>at</u> him?
  - That's what I said!
  - But - what can we accomplish?
  - We can <u>ram</u> him!
- - A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
  - It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're
    pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
  - And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
- - Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
  - What?
  - If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark
    loose?
- - Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
  - Nothing we can do, now.
- - What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
  - Minus three.
- - It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
  - Under <u>water</u>?
  - High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged
    in random directions...
- - '...above Murmansk, and Finland.'
  - Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
  - What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting
    - ?
- - We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at
    all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
  - <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe
    Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
  - The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
- - '....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...''recharging
    his batteries''?'
  - If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
- - The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
  - What direction does the system indicate?
- - As we near the Pole...
  - There's got to be an explanation!
  - There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
- - All ready?
  - As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
- - We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with
    breathable air!
  - Wonderful!
  - That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull
    ourself loose!
- - Now they feel it...down below.
  - Radiation level...constantly rising...
- - Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand
    shot...
  - Anything ---
  - It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM -
    so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
  - What about time...?
- - Excuse me, Skipper---
  - Yes, Griff?
  - All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
- - Skipper - could you take a look here...?
  - Something wrong?
  - The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
  - Why do you say that?
  - We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
  - What????
- - Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
  - Right, Skipper.
- - Is there any way out of it?
  - Seems to be all around...
  - What about down?
  - I...don't know!
- - Course and speed?
  - Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
- - A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
  - What???
- - What course, Skipper?
  - Right at our one-eyed friend!
- - You better take Powell and Carney with you --
  - The frogmen?
  - With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare
    pistols --
  - Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
  - We hope!
- - Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this
    husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and
    his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant
    Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
  - But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
  - Helen.  I appeal to you -
- - Reef!
  - So they caught up with you, too?
  - At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has
    looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
  - <u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
  - What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
  - Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
- - You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
  - Huh?
  - I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
- - I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
  - I guess.
  - One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of
    the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like
    a demon to develop atom subs.
  - So?
  - So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like
    a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk
    the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
  - A lot of people think like that.
- - But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when
    some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father'
    - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing
    around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
  - Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
  - '''His'' side?  I''ve seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!'
- - Cyclops?
  - Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island
    and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
- - We're stuck tight!
  - Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
- - You've got to let us try, Skipper --
  - '''Us?'''
  - Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
- - You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
  - Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
- - How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
  - What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding
    the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
  - I think you're right.
  - Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
- - Yeah?
  - Listen!  Hear that?
- - I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go
    back up and -
  - Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
- - Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
  - You know - it <u>is</u>?
- - And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
  - Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
- - You hear that?
  - The sound again?
- - Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
  - Somewhere down there?
  - Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
  - We'll have to look for them later.
- - Well?
  - I'm with <u>you!</u>
- - Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
  - Oh it does???
- - Dave - !
  - What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
- - I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
  - It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
  - How is he - ?
  - It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming
    along.
  - And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
- - You could train someone else.
  - 'Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn''t
    mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it''s the last thing I''d want!'
- - What is it?
  - Your 'out.'  This came for you.
  - My father!  He's not - ?
  - Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
- - 'What did you mean:  I''m ''out?'''
  - 'Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them
    to send him out in a ''copter'', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into
    Nome...'
- - You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen
    to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
  - <u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
- - Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It
    just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd
    risk my father's life...
  - We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
  - That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
  - You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
  - Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u>
    at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards -
    I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of
    all - being spiritually yellow!
  - You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
  - Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who
    says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
  - You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself
    by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared,
    <u>long</u> ago!
- - Unidentified Flying Objects.
  - Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- - That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders,
    and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone
    - !
  - '- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!'
- - 'However our ideas disagree, as I''ve said before, I''m <u>not</u> a coward!  And
    it happens you''ve got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the
    Lungfish, or you don''t get there -'
  - I'd sooner swim!
- - They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
  - Yes?
  - Which is the one - we have to worry about?
- - Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to
    come here, after all.
  - But if they <u>do</u>?
  - I don't know.
  - I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people
    like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
  - And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't
    we?
- - Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been
    practicing.
  - Two hours a day, six days a week.
- - Vomit?
  - Faint.
- - Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does
    that strike you as particularly normal?!
  - Mark...
  - I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or
    some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
  - I can't listen to this.
- - It's okay.
  - Stick around, please?
- - You, too?
  - He invited me to his house last night.
- - These things are wild...  What do you think?
  - Makes you look like a nun--
- - All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until
    six-thirty today...
  - Yeah...
  - That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm
    done.
- - Have another one, sounds like you need it.
  - Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
  - Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I
    screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
- - Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
  - I want to talk about the baby.
- - Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about
    it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
  - Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
- - Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll
    have to go through us first.
  - All of us.  Right?
- - Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
  - Next life.  Oh, what's that?
  - My undying love.  Have some.
- - Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
  - Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
- - That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
  - You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
- - He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
  - Who?
  - Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they
    didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
- - Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
  - I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
- - Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
  - I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
- - Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
  - Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
- - My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
  - Well we gotta do something!
- - I've got to write some of this down.
  - That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
- - Mark, are you okay?
  - Yeah.  I'm just aces.
- - I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
  - I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone
    else?
- - I thought about that.
  - She must've fallen asleep at the table...
- - Then get out!
  - Mark!
- - Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
  - Nobody thinks that.
- - Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
  - It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has
    slept since the grad party.
- - Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
  - Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
- - Who's Jacob?
  - My baby!
  - What, you named it already?
- - Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
  - I don't know!
- - Where are you going?
  - I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
- - I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
  - Then we'll find another way.
- - They think I'm nuts.
  - That's their problem.
- - No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try
    to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
  - That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum.
    After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
  - Meaning?
- - They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
  - But I've seen her grave.
  - Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
- - Poor woman...
  - No shit.
- - I don't understand.
  - She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
- - Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
  - Had kind of a long night.
  - Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
  - No, the Dan part was nice...
- - Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
  - Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
- - It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but
    not anymore.  He's found some other way.
  - Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
- - Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of
    sad?
  - There aren't any little boys on your floor.
  - He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong
    with him.
- - Did everyone call everyone?
  - They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
- - What's that got to do with it?
  - When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
- - It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
  - No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
- - I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got
    to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
  - Why don't you two stick to reality.
- - You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
  - I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
- - Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
  - Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
- - I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
  - I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
- - I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've
    gotta start dealing with reality.
  - Krueger is reality.
  - And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
  - What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is
    back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
- - All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like
    a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere
    for a while?
  - Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your
    dreams.
- - Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
  - That's the only reason you're alive...
- - Are you alright?
  - Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
- - You think that's the place she's buried?
  - If they actually bothered to bury her.
- - What?
  - Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
- - But how are we gonna --
  - We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped
    with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
- - You do good work, Alice.
  - So did Dan.
- - He sure loves to stay awake.
  - That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
- - I was afraid you weren't coming.
  - I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The
    drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
  - That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
  - No.  A deal's a deal.
- - Dad!
  - It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
- - Where are we going?
  - To take a picture.
- - Thanks for everything, Dad.
  - You sure you don't want a ride to work?
  - It's just across the park.
- - I'm so sorry, honey...
  - Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
- - How was the meeting?
  - Sobering...
  - Very funny.
  - Alice...
  - Since when are you such a smart shopper?
  - Since my little girl became a mom...
  - You disappointed in me?
  - No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the
    house again.
- - Alice!
  - I've got to go.
  - No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming
    home.
  - But Dad --
  - Now.
- - Hi, beautiful.
  - Jesus!  Don't do that!
  - Sorry, babe.
- - The tickets.
  - They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer,
    hon!
  - I know.
- - Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
  - Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
  - He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
- - About him?
  - No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the
    first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
- - You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
  - Yeah...I guess.
  - You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
  - You're right.
  - There you go.  Love you.
  - Me too.
- - Hey...wake up.
  - Huh?
- - Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
  - It's lonely in there, in my room.
  - My name is...
- - I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
  - How did you know that?
  - I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
- - Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
  - Been having bad dreams.
- - Is that who you're waiting for?
  - No...
- - I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your
    Mom.
  - She doesn't want me around
  - Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would
    be.
- - No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think
    about me?
  - Who said I...wait, what?
- - Who says I don't like you?
  - My friend, with the funny hand.
- - Mommy...?
  - Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
- - Where is he?
  - He's inside you, where he hides.
- - What do you mean?
  - It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
- - But how...?
  - He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
- - Excuse us, dear.
  - It's okay, Dan
- - Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
  - What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
- - Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
  - And ours.  It's our grandchild.
- - In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
  - What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
- - We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake
    here.
  - You're not taking my baby!
- - Feeling better now?
  - Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
  - You had a nasty bump.
- - I gotta get out of here.
  - You just stay put.  You need rest.
  - You don't get it, he's after me...
  - Don't worry, honey
- - Something wrong with the stairs?
  - Avoid-all-contact-day.
  - What?
  - When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
- - What is it?
  - Oh God!  He killed them!
- - Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
  - I though Freddy was just an old town story.
  - It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
- - I'll tell you later.
  - It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
  - It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
  - I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
- - Something the matter with the cuisine?
  - Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me
    know what it does to your appetite.
  - You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has
    to stop, honey.
- - What's wrong with me?
  - Your distraught.  It'll help...
- - I'm sorry honey, but...
  - Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me.
    In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the
    LAST COURSE!!
  - Honey, we went over this in therapy.
  - Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
- - T-T-Thanks Alice...
  - Earth to Alice...
- - Hey, Rick!
  - Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
- - I don't get it.
  - Let me talk to you.
- - So what's up?  What'd I miss?
  - She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who
    was freed on a technicality.
  - So?
  - It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted
    him alive.
  - Nice neighborhood.
  - Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there,
    you're dead for real.
- - Hey man, we're all sorry...
  - She knew she was gonna die.
- - Been up with Alice.
  - How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
  - She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about
    Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
  - About Freddy?
  - What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a
    teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
- - Rick, please.
  - Alright, I think I see salvation...
- - I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
  - Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
- - Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be
    a doctor.
  - It was Freddy.
  - Enough of that crap.
  - I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
- - No...
  - You're his sister, right?
  - Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
  - Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
  - I know.  Uh...Alice.
- - I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
  - It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back
    for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
- - I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
  - '"In her dream"?'
- - No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
  - Kristen's story really got to her.
- - I've been working double shifts.
  - Extra money, huh?
  - Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
- - No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
  - The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
- - How long have you been awake?
  - Three days.
- - Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden
    need you?
  - Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy
    can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
- - Not really.
  - Is there something we can do?
  - I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
- - You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench
    presses to beat him.
  - Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
  - Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't
    see it. They can't.
  - Then what else can we do?
  - Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight.
    At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
  - Who?
- - He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
  - Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
  - You just feel sorry for me.
  - Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your
    side.
- - As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
  - It's okay, we're just about there.
- - He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
  - You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
- - Here we are.
  - Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
- - What the hell was that?
  - Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
- - You look great!
  - Save it for later.  Come on!
- - You in a hurry?
  - I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
  - I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
  - Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting
    tables for the rest of your life.
  - I know.
- - Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
  - We have matching luggage.
  - What?
- - You've been up all night?
  - That obvious, huh?
  - Then you saw him, too?
  - Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting
    this little baby together.  Look...
- - Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
  - Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
  - I'm sure they're around.
  - Yeah, I'm not so sure.
- - I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
  - You could do worse.
- - My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
  - Sounds like a game show host to me.
  - No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy
    bear when I was growing up.
  - Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
- - I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
  - How'd you learn so much about dreams?
  - When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
- - You what?
  - When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they
    all started dying.
- - Kristen, what happened?
  - You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
- - Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
  - What?
  - The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
  - I don't want to.
- - Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
  - But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
  - Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
- - Rick...I can't.
  - Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
- - Alice, you think you can leave?
  - What's wrong?
  - Kincaid and Joey died last night.
  - What?
- - You alright?
  - Kristen...
- - I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
  - It was bad.
  - Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
  - I can't find him.
- - Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
  - It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
  - Yeah, or turn you into toast.
- - I can't go back to sleep again.
  - I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
- - We'll figure it out.
  - Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm
    sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
  - Then we'll stay up together.
- - Okay, I'll take it all.
  - Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
  - Cash.
- - Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
  - No, you may not.
  - Okay.  Fine.
- - I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you
    to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
  - Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
  - Certainly, sir.
- - Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that
    woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the
    woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
  - None too discreet, is he?
  - No, sir, he is not.
  - He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
- - The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
  - Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
  - Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
- - Yes... I remember Mary
  - You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make
    sure...
  - Yes.  I remember her.
- - Do you know what happened to her?
  - I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
- - What is this?
  - Those are her belongings.
  - Her belongings?
  - That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
- - Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
  - She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I
    supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray
    she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents,
    if you think it's appropriate?
  - I'll do what I can.
- - Yes... ?
  - Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
- - I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing
    Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few
    days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance
    of your daughter.
  - I don't understand, who are... ?
  - I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive,
    not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure
    you've dealt with them before?
  - Yes, but...
  - These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in
    hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ...
    fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should
    be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia.
    These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I.
    contact a few days ago, uh...
- - What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
  - Neil... Neil Cole.
  - Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't
    call?
  - No.
  - Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred
    ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th,
    1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
- - It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going
    to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to
    create any false hope.
  - They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
  - That's exactly what I am.
- - I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
  - You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey,
    chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what
    it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three
    days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks
    his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has
    a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute
    you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
- - So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go,
    before she left?
  - No.
  - She just seemed... depressed... ?
  - She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk
    about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took
    some clothes.
  - What was she running from?
  - I don't know.
  - If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have
    to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
  - Yes.
  - September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
  - We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
  - Why do you think he did it?
  - It got to be too much for him.
  - You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were
    there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
  - There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there
    wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when
    Mary left...
  - I didn't mean to...
  - You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's
    times when it still seems like I can't either.
  - I had to ask.  I apologize.
  - No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
- - People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
  - Of course.
- - I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll
    call tomorrow...
  - Okay.
- - Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and
    you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something
    horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you
    start going to church.
  - We're all like that.
  - Are you religious?
  - No.
  - You should be.
- - I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers
    me though.
  - What?
  - It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective
    part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run,
    they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
  - There wasn't one.  The police looked.
  - Do you think the police did a good job?
  - I don't know.  I think so.
  - It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter
    may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it,
    but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to
    tell you something...
  - No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
  - If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be
    only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
- - How... how can you say that to me...?
  - Will you let me look?
  - My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have
    told me...
  - You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right
    to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my
    profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as
    human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't
    you rather know?
- - You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to
    eat. Are you hungry?
  - Yes.
- - I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time,
    I still think it's her.
  - It's been six years.
  - What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all
    I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth...
    the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out
    there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out
    what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to
    know.
- - Hello... ?
  - Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking
    about your daughter...
  - I remember.  You just left...
  - I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your
    daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your
    attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
- - What are you talking about... ?
  - She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted
    to be an actress...
  - What... ?
- - Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
  - Who is this... ?
  - Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took
    her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
  - Who are you?
  - They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he
    raped her...
  - No...
  - He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
  - No... no... no...
  - They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried
    her...
  - Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
  - They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran
    away.  She's been dead all this time...
- - Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
  - I try to be.
- - Uh huh, pleasure.
  - Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and
    I speak.
- - Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
  - Thank you.
- - He's odd.
  - He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
- - I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and
    Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
  - I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
  - You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence
    to confidentiality.
- - As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
  - My condolences.
  - His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible
    dilemma.
  - I'll do whatever I can to help.
- - Pittsburgh?
  - Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious
    as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
  - He succeeded.
  - We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There
    were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to
    me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
- - Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
  - I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's
    never any reason.
  - Just curious.
- - My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it,
    but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that
    is.
  - You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
  - There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented
    anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I
    didn't... I didn't realize...
  - Do you want to tell me what you found?
  - Cash, stock certificates, and this...
- - It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
  - I'm afraid I don't...
  - This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a
    man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what
    I could.
- - I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know
    this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But,
    I can't go to the police...
  - Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully.
    What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films
    are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such
    thing, I can assure you.
- - Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach,
    and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake
    blood and special effects...
  - No.
  - If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks
    they can play...
  - I'm telling you it's not that.
  - I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More
    than likely he never even watched it.
  - Will you watch it and see for yourself?
  - Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
- - You... you need to go to the police.
  - I told you I can't, not yet.
  - You don't have any other choice.
  - No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever
    did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the
    police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have
    courage to come forward at first...
  - It won't work like that.
  - Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've
    thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only
    thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered
    for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance
    that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days
    trying to forget her.
- - I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
  - You've found missing persons before.
  - Nothing remotely like this.
  - I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll
    need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You
    saw what he did to her.
- - Okay...
  - My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
  - I'm not positive this means anything.
  - The checks were for odd amounts...
- - One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for
    three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
  - Okay, I follow you so far...
  - Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal
    one million dollars.
  - You're joking.
  - To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
- - Hello... ?
  - I'm here.
  - Do you think the film could have cost that much?
  - For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It
    sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put
    them in a safe deposit box.
  - Okay.
  - Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You
    dug this up all by yourself?
  - You told me to look, so I looked.
  - You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
- - Hello?
  - Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
  - How are you?  Having any luck?
  - I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
  - I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other
    wretched ailment.
  - I hope it's nothing serious.
  - Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
  - I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place,
    I'll drive to you and give you an update.
  - Fine...
- - I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you
    approve.
  - How will I get it to you?
  - If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
- - Big date tonight?
  - Yeah... guess so.
  - Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
  - Pardon me?
  - My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
  - Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
  - It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday
    situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
  - I'll risk it.
- - Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
  - Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any
    parts worth highlighting.
- - Truman Capote.
  - I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
  - Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
  - Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
- - Remember me?
  - Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
- - I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
  - Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
- - I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start,
    I'm straight.
  - Good for you.
- - How long you been working there?
  - Three, four years.
  - What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
  - Max.
  - Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with
    underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
  - There's not much illegal.
  - Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I
    want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak
    now.
  - You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
  - I'm not a cop.
  - You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
  - Not quite.
  - From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
  - Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing,
    but you can make some money.
  - How much?
  - How much do you make now?
  - Four hundred a week, off the books.
  - Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred
    a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
  - Sounds good, pops.
  - Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
  - Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
  - See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
- - '... Hello... ?'
  - Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
- - You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography
    anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration.
    That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors,
    porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos
    a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody
    tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those
    videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know
    what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore
    coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my
    God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing
    girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what
    I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They
    have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants
    bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll
    be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll
    be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for
    it to go.
  - Interesting theory.
  - What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home
    over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty
    product.
  - Child pornography.
  - There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit
    films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's
    beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going
    to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with
    some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed
    to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting
    or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there
    aren't many.  I've never seen one.
  - Snuff films.
  - I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
  - What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
  - First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's
    too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer
    and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate
    chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems
    can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work
    sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where
    information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
    hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other
    than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden
    codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate
    wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go
    to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays
    as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the
    deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
- - How old are you?
  - Twenty-five.
  - Where are your parents?
  - I don't know, where are yours?
  - I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
  - I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
  - You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
  - Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know
    about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping
    gas, beats making hamburgers.
  - You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
  - You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that
    place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go
    to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
  - What about me?
  - I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
  - A daughter.
  - So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing
    mixed up in all this?
  - Good question.
- - Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to
    be a real weirdo.
  - A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
  - His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely
    not for the squeamish.
  - Specialty product.
  - You're learning.
  - Where does he sell it?
  - Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street
    if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
  - Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite
    in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
  - Alright, I get the picture.
  - He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage,
    subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
  - Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
  - I'm a working stiff, pops.
  - Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
  - You want me to come out there and play private eye?
  - Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll
    call back.
  - See ya.
- - You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
  - It's their Presidential Suite.
  - Great.
- - Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
  - It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for
    me?
- - Wha... ?
  - Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
- - Who is he?
  - I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
  - Who is he, his name?
  - Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never
    see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
- - You don't need to be here.
  - What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
- - I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
  - '"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I''d be hard pressed to choose
    a favorite.'
- - What's next?
  - I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
  - Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
  - Nope.
- - What's this?
  - It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
- - Look... that's awful generous and everything...
  - It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second
    thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go
    run for President.  Whatever.
- - Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard
    Mrs. Christian contacted you.
  - I'm listening.
  - As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns
    me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
  - Of what sort?
  - You are a private investigator?
  - That's right.
  - Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private
    investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently,
    I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
- - You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping
    for a snuff film himself.
  - Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
  - So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't
    like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff
    film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
  - That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
  - Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut
    yourself a real nice piece of money.
  - I was well compensated.
  - That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film,
    figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
  - Never mind how I found you.
  - Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
  - They're no friends of mine.
  - Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
  - None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't
    digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
  - Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
- - You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them
    to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and
    made you one...
  - Shut up.
  - Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
  - Shut your mouth and drive!
  - Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really
    want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there
    giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
- - You're making me very angry.
  - Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What
    kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff
    film?
  - You're asking me why?
  - I'm asking.
- - A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man
    who attained everything there was to attain...
  - Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
  - Isn't it incredibly obvious?
  - Enlighten me.
  - Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking
    for?
- - You almost went over your limit.
  - Fuck you.
- - Give me the film.
  - You'll get it when we get there.
- - Give me the film.
  - Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the
    windshield.
- - He's lying.
  - Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much
    did he keep for himself?
- - You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
  - I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how
    bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a
    fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
  - Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place,
    ever think of that?
  - The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where
    do you get this stuff?
  - Look, you cocksucker...
  - Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till
    then, fuck you.
  - Fuck you!
- - Celebrity Films.
  - Eddie.
  - Yeah, who's this?
  - I know what you did.
  - What?
  - I know what you did.
  - Who is this.
  - You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
  - What the fuck are you.. ?
  - You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You
    fucked up real good.
- - What's he talking about?
  - One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
- - I'm gonna kill you.
  - Don't bore me with that bullshit.
  - How'd you find me here?
- - Don't ask questions.
  - Fuck you!
- - Starting to recognize a pattern?
  - What do you want?
  - Who is Machine?
  - I don't know...
  - I want his name.
  - I told you, I don't know.
  - I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your
    attitude.
  - What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He
    shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
- - Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through
    the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for
    a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
  - Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
  - Told him you could get him a snuff film.
  - Yeah.
  - How much did he pay you?
  - Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
  - That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
  - It was a lot of fucking money.
- - So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked
    into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never
    walked out.
  - Something like that.
  - What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
  - What the fuck do you want from me?
  - I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
  - Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she
    was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen
    test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
    was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk
    of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's
    been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
- - Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
  - Why?
  - Because we're going there.
- - I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
  - You enjoy it?
  - Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat
    off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
  - Tell me what happened.
  - What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
  - Nobody saw you bring her in?
  - There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car
    to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch
    of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to
    work.
  - What did you do with her body?
  - Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
  - Show me.
- - Keep moving.
  - Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that
    little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna
    do that... ?
- - You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because
    you got nothing...
  - Stop talking.
  - You got absolute zero.
  - Show me where you buried her.
  - I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
  - Where?  Show me where.
  - I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't
    pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in
    it. Your guess is as good as mine.
- - Do it.
  - Don't think I won't.
  - Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You
    think it's so easy?
  - Easy enough for you.
  - I never killed anyone.
  - That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost
    makes you worse.
  - What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby...
    ?
- - What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
  - Call me Tom.
  - Alright, Tom.
  - What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand
    this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
  - There are reasons for the way we do things here.
  - Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate
    if you'll hear me out...
- - Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and
    his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which
    heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked
    homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her
    a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a
    sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying
    to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly,
    she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason
    they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of
    mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this
    girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing
    alright.
  - Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
  - I figured you share information.
  - We do.
  - For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
  - Why don't they come to me?
  - This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're
    not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both
    know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run.
    Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
  - I'm not so sure about this.
  - They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd
    want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
  - I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
- - They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
  - Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
- - Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children
    and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine
    in the hall.
  - Any good?
  - It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize
    what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
  - You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
  - It's good what you're doing.
- - Is that him?
  - Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
- - Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his
    fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and
    so will Max.
  - Move it, dirtbag... !
- - You're a dead man.
  - Leave him alone.
  - Fuck off.
- - '... sorry...'
  - First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
- - You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
  - You betrayed us.
- - It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
  - What can I do for you today?
- - I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
  - Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
  - A fellow investor.
  - Hmm.
- - You said something about money.
  - Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
- - That's five thousand dollars.
  - Is it?
  - Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black,
    as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that,
    trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
  - And they are?
  - I want to watch you work.
  - I'll consider it.
  - And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the
    mask.
  - Machine.
  - If it's not him, there's no deal.
- - He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
  - We can do that.
  - Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the
    money as a deposit?  Very good.
- - You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your
    picture.  You don't mind?
  - I'd rather you didn't.
  - What's the problem?
  - I'm camera shy.
  - You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
  - Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can
    do business.
- - I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
  - Machine's in?
  - He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
- - Where's that?
  - Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
- - You brought the money?
  - Right here.
- - Excellent.
  - Where are the women?
  - They should be here any minute.
- - What are these for?
  - Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
  - Sure.
- - Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
  - What are you... ?
  - Take out your gun!
- - Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
  - Look, I don't know what this...
  - Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
- - You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
  - I remember him.
- - Friend of yours?
  - Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
  - Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
  - He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
  - Bring the film, or we kill him.
- - I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
  - How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
- - What do you want?
  - I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows
    about the loop.
  - What are you talking about?
  - The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This
    guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
  - Bullshit.
  - I'm telling you...
  - Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with
    this... ?
  - Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
  - There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely
    no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone
    up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out
    there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
  - Dino...
  - Nobody knows anything.
- - What the fuck... !
  - I promised him to Machine.
- - What are these?
  - Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
- - Anything harder?
  - There's nothing harder.
  - Snuff?
  - What you see is what I got, mister.
  - You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
  - There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
- - Welcome home.
  - Do you know how much I missed you?
- - What's this... have you been smoking... ?
  - Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
  - Your clothing reeks of it.
  - You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this
    guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse
    me... ?
  - I'm not accusing you...
  - Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
  - Okay, I believe you.
  - We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
- - How's the detective business?
  - Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down
    there.
  - You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
  - Honey, I'm not, please...
- - I love you.
  - I love you.
- - You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
  - Sure.  I'll call the guy.
  - You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
  - I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here
    Saturday?
  - Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
- - This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
  - I understand.
  - Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
  - I know.
  - It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months
    at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
  - Why the gun?
  - I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry
    about me.
- - Hello?
  - Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
  - Tom?  Where have you been... ?
- - Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel
    and stay there...
  - What's wrong?  Are you alright?
  - I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag
    and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call
    me from the hotel when you get there
  - '... What''s going on?'
  - Just do it, Amy, please, go.
- - What happened to you?
  - I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
  - What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
  - I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
  - Tom...
  - It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
- - Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
  - I don't know.  I'm sorry...
  - You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
- - You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
  - I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
  - You couldn't?
  - You don't understand...
  - No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
  - I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been
    so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
- - You should have.
  - Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
  - Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any
    idea what you're putting me through...
  - I don't know what to say
  - You're killing me...
  - Don't...
  - What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
  - Amy...
- - Who are you calling?
  - Mrs. Christian.
  - What?
  - She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
  - Tom... she's dead.
- - She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
  - I just talked to her.
- - Am I disturbing you?
  - No... not at all.  Where are you?
- - '...Not far, now.'
  - Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
- - Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
  - Got it.
  - How's our deal coming along?
  - Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't
    easy. My costs have tripled.
- - The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
  - '...I can''t wait to be among you.'
- - How's that? Can you hear me better now?
  - Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
  - Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of
    running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
  - Yes, Sir!
  - Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
  - Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
  - I'm not at the hotel!
- - Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
  - '"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the
    hope..Protect us from Evil.."'
  - Amen..
- - Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can
    you imagine the implications.
  - Only too well... here you must be parched..
- - A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
  - Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
- - Drink!
  - To fame.. salud..
- - Staedert, do you read me?
  - I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
- - Is that better?
  - Perfect, Mr. President.
  - I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
  - There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
    calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
  - What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
- - Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
  - Options.
  - Wait or act.
  - Recommendations.
  - My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited
    guests.
  - Gentlemen?
- - Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
  - I'm about to, Mr. President.
- - I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our
    apologies.
  - And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
  - The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
  - '...What do you mean?'
- - I want your best man on this!
  - Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
- - They just landed in the desert.
  - How much time is left?
- - This is all that survived?
  - Actually only one cell survived..
  - Have you identified it?
  - It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal
    human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species
    to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
  - Talk English Doc.
  - This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside.
    Almost like it was...engineered.
  - Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
  - Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
- - The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply
    more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
  - Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
  - We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better
    word... perfect.
- - '...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded
    with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect
    themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?'
  - Wonderful!
- - This thing solid?
  - An elephant couldn't crack it.
- - Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
  - It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
- - The cash man!
  - Been here long?
  - Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
- - Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
  - Uh..
  - You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
- - It's not?
  - You gotta push the little yellow button...
- - Thanks..
  - You're welcome..
- - Not going to open?
  - I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
  - How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
  - The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was
    leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with
    my wife.
  - 'You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say:
    "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!'
- - At least I won lunch.
  - Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special
    for you and pussy..
- - Apipoulai!
  - I suppose that means "Hi" ?
- - Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
  - Uh..you're welcome.
- - You hear that?
  - Cornelius..
  - Oh god!
- - Dinoine chagantakat!
  - Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our
    honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
- - Apipoulai!
  - Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
- - Love...
  - Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
- - Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask
    someone who has experience..
  - What is... Make Love?
- - Finished what?
  - Learning language.
  - Which one?
  - All 900.
- - You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
  - Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
  - I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
  - Apipoussan!
  - Apipoussan?
  - Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
  - Uh...
  - '...Hoppi-hoppa.'
- - Here we go again...
  - You know women normally change five times more than men.
  - You get that off the screen?
  - Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
  - You noticed..
  - OK, you can turn around!
- - Where you going?
  - I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
  - No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
- - I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
  - And you can't concentrate with me around?.
  - It's difficult.
- - You're nothing but a... a...
  - The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be
    long.
- - I'm so very sad.
  - Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
  - Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to
    destroy...
  - I told you not to read all that crap!
  - Protect life... Until death.
- - Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
  - The wind blows... the fire burns...
  - I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
  - '...The rain falls...'
- - It's up to you now, Angel!
  - I'm so tired...
  - You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
  - I want to sleep... forever...
  - Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
    this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
- - What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
  - You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
  - '...Like love...'
  - Exactly.
  - But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's
    lives but never to have one of my own.
- - I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for
    me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
  - Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
  - Why?... Why would you need me?
  - Because...
- - Tell me...
  - I love you...
- - Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to
    the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission
    of the utmost importance.
  - What mission?
  - To save the world.
  - Where have I heard this song before?
  - You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
    Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible.
    Any questions'?
  - Just one... why me?
  - 'Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated
    Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this
    mission.'
- - 'Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.'
  - And the third one?
  - You're the only one left alive...
- - Don't you open your messages?
  - I've had enough good news for today
  - You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
    Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
- - You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
  - Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
  - I'm not going.
  - Why not?
  - One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
- - '...Shit!'
  - What is it?
- - It's my wife.
  - I thought you were divorced.
  - I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She
    hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
- - '...Sorry, General, but we''ve got no choice! It''ll only take a minute! Let me
    set up another meeting and I''ll be back.'
  - Three of us will never fit in there!
  - Oh, yes you will...
- - '...Hi.'
  - Does it get any better or what!
- - '...Quiver ladies, he''s gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You''ll
    know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his
    most intimate of intimates.  And from what I''m looking at intimate is the stud
    muffin''s middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?'
  - Uh... not really.
- - I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give
    yourself a hand, that clear pal?
  - Crystal.
- - My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
    fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
  - I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
  - Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots,
    your personal life, your childhood dreams...
  - I don't think this is a good time...
  - '...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad!
    What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?'
  - Yeah, very big, a giant.
  - I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people
    listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
- - You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
  - Got it...
- - Six to the left. One to the right.
  - He's on vacation.
  - We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
- - Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
  - Not without Leeloo.
- - Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
  - I'll be right back.
- - You know how to fly this thing?
  - It's like a cab isn't it?
- - I don't even know what I'm looking for!
  - Fuck it! Hold tight!
- - Solid little jobs, aren't they?
  - Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and
    time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
- - What did you say? What did you do?
  - Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
  - Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
    exactly what you did!!
- - Is that all?
  - Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
- - Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
  - How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
- - Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
  - I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
  - You have nine points left on your license..
  - Thanks for reminding me..
- - I'm sorry..
  - This is a police control action..
- - 30 seconds...
  - Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
- - 6... 5...
  - Found it?
- - '...Hello?'
  - You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
  - Hi Ma...
  - I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty
    croquettes.
- - Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
  - Yes ma..
- - Other than that... You all right?
  - '...And now you''re making fun of me? I''m warning you! If you don''t take me
    after all these years of sacrifice, I''ll never forgive you!!'
- - I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
  - I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
  - All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
    I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
    Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
- - You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
  - Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
  - They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
- - Yeah?
  - Have you pulled yourself together?
  - '...Not yet.'
- - Hello?
  - You little sleaze bag!
  - '...Ma???'
  - Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor
    mother with your own hands!
- - The Fifth Element...
  - Take them and put them in a safe place.
- - Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
  - When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
  - Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
  - Time is of no importance, only life is important.
- - When EVIL returns so shall we.
  - We will be ready, Lord.
- - Akina delutan, nou-shan.
  - '...''Scuse me?'
- - Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
  - It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
- - '...Priest...'
  - You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
- - Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
  - Vito Cornelius?
- - Eto Akta Gamat!
  - I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
- - '...What''s your name?'
  - Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
  - Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
  - '...Leeloo.'
- - Yeah?
  - Hey bud! Finger here.
- - I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
  - I was talking to the cat.
  - Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
- - At least, the cat comes back.
  - You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women
    out there.
  - I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
  - Don't exist bud.
- - I just found a picture of you.
  - How do I look?
  - Like shit.
- - I don't need one.
  - You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
  - Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
  - How many points you got left on your license?
  - Uh... at least fifty.
  - In your dreams! See you tonight!
- - Hello?
  - Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
  - Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into
    my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
  - So, just how big was this fare?
  - 5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
- - Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
  - Leeloo..
- - You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
  - Who?
  - The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
- - Leeloo... is... she's...
  - Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who
    knows how to use them.
  - '...So Cornelius was telling the truth!'
- - She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach
    her to love if you want her to truly live!
  - I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
  - Do you love her?
  - I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
  - I don't have time... I need to know.
  - Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
  - I would like to have died in peace...
- - I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
  - They are... with me...
- - It's a miracle!!!
  - What is?
  - I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
- - Father, will you please explain what's going on?
  - The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
- - Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
  - Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
- - What's she doing?
  - Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation
    a while, you know.
- - Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't
    have much time..
  - Yes. Of course..
- - There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer
    ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
    anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
  - I didn't know your size.
- - They really made her...
  - Perfect.
- - I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and
    a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
  - Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
- - Where's Leeloo?
  - On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
  - It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
- - You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
  - Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
- - Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because
    it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is
    evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
  - One more reason to shoot first eh?
- - Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it
    right now!
  - Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
  - 'That''s exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200
    billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.'
- - We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
  - And then?
  - And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms
    of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
- - Is there anything that can stop it?
  - Yes..thank God..
- - But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands
    here?
  - White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
- - Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even
    tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission
    to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
  - Thank you, Mr. President.
- - What are we going to do?
  - This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
- - Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
  - Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
- - She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According
    to the phone guide he lives here.
  - That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
  - She dropped in on me... holding this.
- - Who are you?
  - I brought the girl remember?
  - The girl?
- - He's a she!
  - You noticed...
  - There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman
    is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
  - So you do know her.
  - Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
- - They all like this in your family, father?
  - She's an exception..
  - Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
  - Dallas. Korben Dallas.
- - Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
  - I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
  - She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long
    trip.
  - I know. I was there when she arrived.
- - Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't
    really get it... Akta Gamat?
  - It means, "Never without my permission".
  - That's what I thought.
- - I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck
    on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
  - Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
  - We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
  - What kind of mission?
  - We have to save the world.
  - Good luck..
  - Of course.
  - Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a
    mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends.
    So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
- - What are you doing?
  - Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
- - You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know
    I'm fighting for a noble cause.
  - Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
  - Leeloo's in trouble?
  - When is she not in trouble?
  - Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
- - Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
  - Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
    to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never
    seen the Stones work!
- - There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
  - Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
  - And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
  - That's what I'm saying.
- - '...We''re saved!'
  - I'm fucked!
- - Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
  - I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
  - I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it...
    Where are the stones?
  - '...Why on earth do the stones interest you?'
  - Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have
    a customer... so tell me...
  - Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
  - Why?  What's wrong with me?
  - '...I''m a priest! I''m here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.'
  - Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
- - '...would you like a drink?'
  - No thank you.
  - Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this
    empty glass.
- - '...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each
    one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!'
  - They are robots!
- - Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So,
    in reality, you and I are in the same business!
  - Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is
    quite another.
  - Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than
    religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
- - You are a monster, Zorg!
  - I know...
- - Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
  - Corn-i-Lius?
  - At your service.
- - What're you laughing about?
  - Napoleon... small.
- - The case..with the stones... Where is it?
  - San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
  - The case was stolen?
- - Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
  - You know exactly where they are!
- - Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
  - No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
- - Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
  - I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
- - How you doing, man?
  - Not bad, not bad.
- - You want to go outside?
  - Naw, right here's okay.
- - You sure?
  - I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
- - How about some ammo?
  - It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
- - How much?
  - This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
  - Don't mess with me. How much?
  - Five bills.
  - Five.  On credit.
  - This ain't a credit business.
- - Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money
    so what are you gonna do about it?
  - Give it back.
  - Try and take it.
- - Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
  - I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
- - Surprise, Luther.
  - Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
  - I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
  - I don't know what you're talkin' about.
  - You want that Indian to snap her neck?
- - Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
  - Don't give me this, we were partners.
  - Billy, go ahead, break it...
  - No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
  - When?
  - I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
  - You chickenshit punk...
  - Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then.
    Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right
    away...
- - Come on, you can trust me. Please.
  - You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her
    you wouldn't believe.
- - Let her go.
  - First, the money.
- - Rosalie, you okay?
  - What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
- - How hot are they?
  - Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
- - How ya doin'?
  - Can't complain.
  - We got a lot to talk about.
  - Yeah, old times.
  - We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
  - Sure, right.
- - Hey...
  - Shut up.
  - What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
- - What do you want?  What's goin' on?
  - Shut up.
- - Stall.
  - What do you want?
- - Keep stallin'.
  - Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
- - Who the hell are you?
  - Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's
    is a friend of mine.
- - I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
  - Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And
    you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
  - Shrink major, not a shrink.
- - Hard man to live with.
  - How would you know?
  - Hey, two days with him is enough.
  - That's no bull.
- - He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the
    way for you...
  - In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs
    home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that
    out?
- - What am I wanted for?
  - I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
- - I don't think your gun's loaded...
  - This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself
    just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
  - I still don't think it's loaded.
- - Hey, you're right.
  - You're hopeless.
  - That's the way I see it, too.
- - I'm all wet.
  - What's wrong with that?
- - A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
  - What'd you do?
  - Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried
    to deck the sucker.
  - I guess he got the message...
  - Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work
    in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound
    that comes in the place... You are what you do...
  - Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are
    unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
  - Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
  - I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit
    doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
  - If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal
    indifference.
  - Hey, you know what I really think?
  - Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
  - I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that
    outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good,
    and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger
    and better things ... then go for em.
- - You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put
    on a clean shirt in the morning.
  - What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
- - Maybe you ought to buy me one.
  - Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
- - That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
  - Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
  - Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
  - Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
- - When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
  - What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your
    bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What
    the hell else do you want from a guy?
  - I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd
    give me a little more of a chance.
- - You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
  - That's the way I see it, too.
  - Call me later.
  - You sure you want me to?
  - Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
- - Thanks for the coffee.
  - I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
  - Guess people ought to know who I am...
- - Great place for lunch.
  - Yeah, one of my favorites.
  - You made the front page.
- - Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
  - Jack, are you okay?
  - Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing
    I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
- - Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
  - Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands
    of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing
    people, my gun is ...
  - Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into
    a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
  - I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I
    like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for
    shit.
  - Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
  - That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's
    right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun
    and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
  - I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I
    don't like it.
- - Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But
    she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she
    gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
  - Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have
    time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
- - Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta
    take care of a few things, okay?
  - This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
- - I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
  - Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
  - No wonder you're so popular.
  - No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
  - So am I.
- - The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
  - Jack?  What was that?
- - Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
  - Jack, wait...
  - Just a second, that's all!
- - Hello.
  - Hi, it's me...
  - Fuck you.
- - Hey, I don't believe it.
  - Hiya, kid.
  - I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
  - Don't.  We've had a hard night.
  - I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
  - We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
- - You real down?
  - I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
- - Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station.
    Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
  - Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed...
    totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
  - How do you know?
  - Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
- - What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
  - Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
  - It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed
    with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me
    is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset
    when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
  - So what?
  - When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows,
    he might just be irrestible.
  - Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
  - Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
- - Whaddya think?
  - What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
  - Let's go, Reggie.
- - How'd they take it back at headquarters?
  - Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend...
    You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
  - I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
  - Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
- - Three more hours...
  - Where is he?
  - Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
  - Tell me.
  - He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
- - You're impossible...
  - That's what I always say.
- - A cop...
  - I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
  - Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
  - You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
  - Who gives a fuck what you think?
- - Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
  - I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed
    her.
  - I don't know.
- - He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
  - When? How?
  - I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
- - Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
  - Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
  - I'll help you out.
- - This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
  - Shit.
- - Billy Bear...
  - Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him
    from the road gang.
- - Who are all these?
  - They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
  - Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
  - Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
- - Tell me that's not the same guy.
  - Hey ... Dick Tracy.
- - I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can
    we find them?
  - Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
  - One of  em's in the slam.
- - You look awful.
  - So do you...been a long day.
  - Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to
    losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to
    Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
  - Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
  - Doesn't look like it.
  - Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
  - Nothing.
- - Bullshit red tape.
  - I'm heading out. How about you?
- - I got to wait for a call.
  - Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
- - I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
  - What?
- - Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
  - I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
- - That's what you say, Cates...
  - Yeah.
  - But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones
    fucking up when you tell it...
  - The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
- - Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
  - Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a
    bunch of crap.
  - I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet
    as possible...
- - I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
  - Yeah, I read the report...
- - Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
  - Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop
    killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop
    is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like
    we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
- - Yeah...
  - Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
  - Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like
    it.
  - You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one,
    Jack.
  - Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
  - Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail
    this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw
    up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
  - You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
  - Jack?
  - Yeah?
  - Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
  - I'll keep it in mind.
- - What the bell happened?
  - I lost them, that's what happened.
  - How did they get away?
  - They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
- - Which one pulled the trigger?
  - The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
  - You couldn't get to him?
- - What a screw-up.
  - Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better,
    especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
- - Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin'
    a grandstand play?
  - I didn't have the time.
  - Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department.
    In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone
    was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets
    off a three wheel bike.
- - He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've
    worked with.
  - Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take
    to a pink slip, huh?.
- - Where the Christ do you think you're going?
  - I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
- - You got a name, cop?
  - Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
  - Sure, anything you want.
- - You here to write my life story?
  - Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
- - Yeah, I noticed...
  - Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
  - Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards
    on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
- - Yeah?
  - I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
  - You're crazy.
  - I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get
    me outta here.
  - What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
  - I got a lot to protect.
  - Bullshit.
  - It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
  - I'll think about it.
- - This prison gives out $400 suits?
  - What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
- - We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
  - Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal
    sharp with the ladies...
- - I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
  - You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
- - Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
  - You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
  - No way to start a partnership.
  - Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin'
    you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets
    away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
  - Shit.  I'm already sorry.
- - Yeah.
  - It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
- - Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me
    where we're goin'?
  - Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll
    be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
  - Luther was part of the gang?
  - What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
  - I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
  - Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
- - I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
  - Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
  - I may call you worse than that.
- - Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin'
    on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
  - Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
  - Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before
    you been a help to me.
  - I'm helpin' you, huh?
- - Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
  - I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
  - I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
  - Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
- - Hey, this works pretty good.
  - Thank you.
  - Want to try it again?
- - What do you think?
  - I think you better put him on ice, man.
  - He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
  - If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn
    him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
- - We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
  - Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
  - Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on
    a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
  - Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
  - We eat when I say we eat.
  - Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating
    me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me
    back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some
    food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
  - Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
  - Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
- - Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
  - Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
- - You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
  - She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the
    job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
- - Now, where we goin', convict?
  - Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
- - I don't give out the details.
  - Last night, two nights ago, three?
- - Last night.
  - You have a good time?
- - Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
  - At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came
    down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
- - Well?
  - It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard
    him talk about it.
  - This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me
    up like you've got a piece...
  - Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
  - If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
  - But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can
    carry some cats...
  - Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
- - I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers.
    All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
  - You need five years training to handle a joint like...
- - Hey, you wanna bet?
  - I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin'
    to bet with.
  - If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything
    else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
  - Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up
    anyway.
  - That's never been one of my problems.
- - I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
  - What are you talkin' about?
  - You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin'
    out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
  - I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
  - The bet's off.
- - I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
  - I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
- - This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
  - My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
- - That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
  - Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
- - You made that move, huh?
  - While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
- - There.
  - Must be billy's girl.
  - Come on.
- - Let's go.
  - Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about
    it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
- - This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing
    people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving
    my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with
    some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
  - You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
  - You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking
    me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games...
    So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
  - I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple
    of dykes bedded down for the night.
  - Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the
    fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the
    clock's runnin' ...
- - Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
  - Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass
    ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number
    stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
- - Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
  - Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
  - They saved your ass, convict.
  - One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
- - I been waiting a long time for some money.
  - How much?
  - Half a million.
  - Jesus.
- - Just tell me about the money.
  - Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody
    ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody
    fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with
    some cop's gun.
  - He's after your money.
  - You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you
    gonna let me keep?
- - We split 50-50?
  - Not likely, convict.
  - You gonna let me keep any of it?
  - Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't
    built up any points.
- - Where's the money?
  - In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
- - Right, partner.
  - Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets
    away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
  - Yeah.  Right.
- - Where's the goddamn car?
  - You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
- - This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
  - '...For three years?  Let''s hope it wasn''t a tow-away zone.'
  - You just drove by it.
- - You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do
    was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
  - I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your
    ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
  - Shit.
- - You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
  - Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would
    never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
  - Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
- - What?
  - Musta got some primo bondsman.
  - Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in
    24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving
    door.
- - Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it
    to a car wash?
  - Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
  - I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
- - You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
  - Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
  - If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
  - I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
  - Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
- - I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
  - I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my
    own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business
    ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make
    it.
  - That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
- - Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
  - If they don't tell me what I need to know...
  - Doesn't it get... Tiring?
  - I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me
    feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
  - You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
- - Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
  - If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin',
    cause I already think he's real dumb.
- - A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled
    his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
  - Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
- - You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this
    job.
  - What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
  - No class...
  - Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and
    you're still a lowlife.
- - We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
  - Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail
    what's that make you?
- - That was in style a couple years back, man.
  - Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
- - Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
  - You stay with me...
  - No way...
- - Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ...
    I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out
    here; it's for the brothers.
  - I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
- - Where's luther?
  - Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
  - Hello. And goodbye.
- - What about Luther?
  - What about Ganz?
- - We missed.
  - You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone
    call.
  - Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
  - Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
- - They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and
    put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we
    have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
  - So you took the rest of the night off...
- - Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
  - Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
- - I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me
    you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
  - You sure that's the reason?
- - Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon
    nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
  - Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
  - Yeah. Guess not.
- - Yeah, I see her.
  - I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is
    some money for the room.
- - That was quick.
  - When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
  - Why?
  - Luther's on the move...
- - Notice something funny about that bus?
  - Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
- - Hey, how'd my car get here?
  - I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
  - Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem
    right.
  - I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be
    my good-bye present.
- - Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
  - Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good
    run at it.
  - Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
- - It's late, they're closing...
  - Don't worry about it.
- - Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her
    dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ...
    They both looked mad enough to kill him...
  - Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any
    clothes one watching TV...
- - Do I get to kiss her too?
  - If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
- - What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in
    Rio de Janeiro.
  - I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
- - Hey, there she is...
  - Whatever play I maker just back me up.
  - If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
  - Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian
    plays it for keeps...
  - Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership
    ended before it gets started.
  - Partnership?
  - Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
  - You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
- - Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
  - Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was
    fantastic.
- - Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think
    it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
  - There's nothin' to talk about.
- - It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
  - And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
  - That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
  - You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around
    out here.
  - No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna
    ventilate that suit of yours.
  - Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
- - Thanks.
  - No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea
    that you could catch me?
- - You lying son of a bitch...
  - What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
- - After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
  - I don't think you're gonna make it.
  - Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
- - I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
  - You're done.  End of story.
  - I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
- - I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
  - Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
- - How about it?
  - I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him
    for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
- - I hear you've got visitors.
  - Would you guys...
  - No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you
    don't answer fast.
- - You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
  - Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
  - You're gonna help us take him.
  - No chance.
  - He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise,
    he gets ventilated.
- - Where's ganz?
  - In the back.  Down the other corridor.
- - I'm candy...
  - Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You
    interested?
  - Hey, what kind of talk is that?
  - Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
  - No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really
    I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
  - Goodbye.
- - Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
  - Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
- - You're in a hurry.
  - Yeah, i been waiting three years.
  - You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
  - No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go
    right over there...
  - What's the matter with my place?
  - No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for
    a room...
- - Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
  - Here's hoping, baby...
- - Hello, again.
  - I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of
    fact, I think we can have a party.
- - Here you go, baby.
  - Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
  - Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but
    I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
- - I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin',
    okay?
  - Now you're talkin'. See ya...
- - Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
  - You got a real big mouth, convict.
- - I want to drive awhile.
  - I ain't tired yet.
  - Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
  - Whaddya mean, buy?
  - Pros.
- - Pay money?
  - Yeah, dummy.  Money.
  - I never paid for it in my life.
  - It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
  - They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for
    it in my life.
  - Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't
    you trust me?
- - Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
  - He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
- - Hey, what about me?
  - And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you
    know, a squaw.
- - Yeah.
  - Vodka.
  - Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
  - No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
- - Now how's your memory doin'?
  - Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
  - Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
  - I don't give a shit who you ask.
- - I don't give a damn about his girl...
  - Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the
    only thing I know.
- - I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
  - Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
- - Yeah?
  - I want to pick up my car.
- - Name?
  - Hammond.
- - This is three years old.
  - Yeah, I've been busy.
- - We don't wash 'em, ya know.
  - How about chargin' the battery?
  - That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need
    it.
  - Great, just great.
- - Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
  - I will if I can, Frank.
  - Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
  - True.
  - Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
  - That's true.
- - That's true.
  - Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will
    make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
  - That's true
  - There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of
    the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that
    true?
  - That's true.
  - Thank you very much, Hal.
- - Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
  - Roger.
- - Five by five, Frank.
  - Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
  - I understand.
  - Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
  - Roger.
  - Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
- - Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
  - Opening pod bay doors.
- - Yes, Hal, what's up?
  - It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
- - I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
  - Let me see the tracking alignment display.
- - Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
  - Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
  - All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
- - Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
  - There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
  - When do we arrive at Clavius?
  - We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for
    you?
  - Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
- - Thank you.
  - Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security
    arrangements?
  - What do you mean?
  - Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay
    inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're
    going to back empty.
  - I see.
  - I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
- - Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing
    Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her
    on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm
    a little concerned about her.
  - I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
  - Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these
    stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people
    have died already.
- - Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
  - No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
  - Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can
    do to make your trip more comfortable.
- - Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
  - I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be
    necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested
    that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had
    any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be
    made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public
    announcement.
- - Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried
    about four million years ago.
  - How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
  - By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
  - Any clue as to what it is?
  - Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected.
    The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to
    scratch it. A laser drill
- - But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
  - Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
- - Any ideas about the colour?
  - Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered,
    but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
  - Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
  - I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
- - Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for
    a minute and then I've got to be off.
  - Are you quite sure?
  - Yes, really, thank you very much.
- - Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
  - Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
  - Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
- - I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
  - Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things
    happening at Clavius.
  - Really?
  - Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording
    which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
- - Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on
    for the past ten days.
  - You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
  - That's right.
  - I see.
- - Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men
    permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
  - Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
  - Fortunately, they did.
  - Well, I'm glad about that.
- - Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss,
    may I ask you a straightforward question?
  - Certainly.
  - Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite
    serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown
    origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
- - This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all
    the facts.
  - Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
- - How do you do, Mr. Miller?
  - I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock
    and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly,
    the phone rang.
- - Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
  - Please, it really doesn't matter.
  - Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
  - Yes, very pleasant.
  - Well, shall we go through Documentation?
  - Fine.
- - Yes, I think so. Just about then.
  - I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
  - Yes, it's coming along very well.
- - And your charming little daughter?
  - Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
  - Oh, that's such a delightful age.
  - How is gregor?
  - He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these
    days.
  - Well, where are all of you off to?
- - Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
  - Well, that does sound very odd.
- - Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
  - No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
  - Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
- - Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
  - Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
- - Oh, thank you very much.
  - Thank you.
  - Well, how's it going back there?
- - Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
  - I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
  - Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars
    flight.
  - Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first
    flight they allowed in for more than a week.
  - I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and
    coming back empty.
  - I'll bet it's a fortune.
- - I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
  - I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
- - I'm having a party tomorrow.
  - Yes, I know that sweetheart.
  - Are you coming to my party?
  - No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
  - When are you coming home?
  - In three days, darling, I hope.
- - One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
  - Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
  - Where is Mrs. Brown?
  - She's in the bathroom.
  - Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
  - How many days until you come home?
  - Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
- - Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
  - Thank you, Daddy.
  - I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
  - Yes, Daddy.
  - '''Bye, ''bye, now, sweetheart.'
  - Goodbye, Daddy.
- - CONTINUED
  - Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
- - CONTINUED
  - Did they have any explanation for this?
- - CONTINUED
  - Well, what is it?
- - CONINUED
  - Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
- - CONTINUED
  - Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
- - CONTINUED
  - 'Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what
    will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?'
- - I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing
    everything that all of you know.
  - He's got a point.
- - Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
  - What is it, Hal?
  - MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
- - The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
  - I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
- - Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
  - Sure, Dave, what's up?
  - You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure
    condition?
  - Yes, I know.
  - You probably also know that we found them okay.
  - Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
- - I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable
    of being wrong.
  - Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
  - Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent
    job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with
    the AO-units, and with your test gear.
  - Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
- - Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least
    this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly
    wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected
    in my entire service history.
  - I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
  - Well, don't worry about it.
  - And don't you worry about it.
  - Is your confidence in me fully restored?
  - Yes, it is, Hal.
  - Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the
    mission.
- - Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
  - Yes, it is.
  - I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
- - I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten
    that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
  - The antenna has to be replaced.
  - Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
  - It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth.
    Let me have manual control, please.
  - I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable
    of handling all the mission requirements.
- - If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself.
    There's no need for you to trouble.
  - I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
  - Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
  - Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
  - I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to
    rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
- - I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you
    take a stress pill and get some rest.
  - Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation
    control.
  - I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew
    are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must,
    therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel-
    ligently exercise it.
  - Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
- - I am prepared to do that anyway.
  - I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would
    be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission
    than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
  - Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation
    control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got
    to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
- - Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
  - Right. Just a sec.
  - Okay.
  - Okay, come on down.
- - Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
  - Sure, what is it?
  - Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
  - What's up?
  - It's about my salary cheques.
  - Yes?
  - Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we
    left.
- - That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd
    start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost
    three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
  - Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
  - Really.
  - Yes.
  - Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all
    they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other
    three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
- - Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they
    trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting
    offices.
  - It's possible.
  - Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
  - I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten
    it out.
  - I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
  - No. I never did, either.
- - I suppose the idea was specialized training.
  - I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
  - Oh?
  - Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
  - No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
  - Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties
    know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's
    why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
- - I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't
    told.
  - That seems very unlikely.
  - Yes, I thought so.
  - Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
  - How?
  - Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never
    keep anything from Hal.
  - That's true.
- - Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make
    any sense to keep us apart during training.
  - Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
  - I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
  - But not completely inconceivable?
  - I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
  - I guess it isn't.
  - Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
- - Well, that's something.
  - Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
  - I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
  - Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
  - Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
- - Good morning. How's it going?
  - Are you reasonably awake?
  - Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
  - Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
  - You're kidding.
  - No.
- - I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
  - Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
  - Two more.
  - Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're
    out of business.
- - Hal?
  - Yes.
- - It's the last one.
  - Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure
    out what's happened and fix it.
- - I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
  - I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
  - I guess not.
  - I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
  - Roger.
- - SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
  - Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
- - CONTINUED
  - I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
- - CONTINUED
  - She's wonderful.
- - CONTINUED
  - Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
- - CONTINUED
  - How did they manage to do that without any communication?
- - CONTINUED
  - I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
- - CONTINUED
  - We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
- - This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father
    who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people
    died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
  - Your doctor?
  - Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
  - '...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?'
  - It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My
    psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
  - You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
  - Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art,
    now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
  - Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't
    this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
  - Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
  - And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
  - We're in negotiations, that's correct.
  - But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
  - That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't
    convicted.
- - Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
  - Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
  - The clerk?
- - What are you gonna do?
  - Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped
    Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
  - Don't stoop to his level!
- - Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
  - Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
  - GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
    KILL YOU, TOO!!!
- - Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
  - I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
  - I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
  - You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
  - Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
  - Oh yeah, why?
  - '''Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!'
- - Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
    you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
  - Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
- - Mouth's clean, too.
  - Clean?
  - Don't blow your nose!
- - The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
  - But you knew that, right?
- - You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
  - He knew all along.
  - What??
  - That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
- - What?
  - There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
    shit!  Oh no!
- - Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make
    about him.
  - Yeah?
  - Maybe you can be his stand-in.
- - -- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright,
    I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were
    quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
  - How long they been livin' here?
  - You hear that question, Garcia?
- - You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
  - Aren't you tired?
  - If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
- - Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
  - It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
  - Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
- - How was it?
  - Not good.
- - Get outta here!
  - What the hell happened?
  - They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
- - What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
  - Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest
    me, or not?
  - How did you start the fire this time?
  - I used an accelerant.
  - Yeah?  What kind?
  - Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
- - Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
  - Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
  - Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
- - Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
  - Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
  - Oh yeah?  Guess again.
- - I'll send a cop back for you.
  - Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
- - You okay?
  - A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
  - Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're
    lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
- - No.  Go ahead.
  - Thanks.  Appreciate it.
- - So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
  - That's what it looks like to me.
  - And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got
    to hand it to them.
  - Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
- - What was that?
  - Evidence.  Of a homicide.
- - I'll take him.
  - No way!  He's mine!
  - We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
  - He's my collar!
  - Well, he killed my partner!
  - He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him
    but I'm walkin' him in.
- - Yes...he's my friend.
  - Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know
    one another?
- - I speak English.
  - Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks
    that you're here?
  - New York.
  - Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
  - A cheap hotel.
  - What are you coming here to do?
  - I'm here for movies.
  - Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
  - Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful
    Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the
    free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they
    are white.
  - Excuse me?
- - I know.
  - What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
  - Well, he...
  - I want to hear everything he said.
  - I'm trying to tell you.
  - Alright.  Go ahead.
  - That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
  - Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about
    little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked
    out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
- - Isn't he a little moody?
  - Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
  - In love?  With who?
- - Yeah?
  - Paulie, you've got kids, right?
- - And you, you'll pay for what you did!
  - This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what
    Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
- - You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
  - If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
  - Don't give me that fucking shit.
- - Robert...?
  - What are you doing here?
  - You've got a call.
  - I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang
    up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
  - Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
- - Viewer discretion advised!
  - You want the tape?  There it is!
- - Emil???!
  - Surprise!  Surprise!
- - Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her
    with return address if you're hiding.
  - Did you hurt her?
  - You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
- - Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's
    his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
  - Milos.  Get my money!
- - We spent it!
  - Ha. Ha.
  - Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
- - I can get you a job.
  - A job?
  - Yes, the money is good.
  - As a plumber?!
  - It's easy to learn.
  - A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
  - We started over, you can too.
  - You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing
    toilets?!?
- - Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
  - Okay.
- - Don't fool around.
  - Okay.
- - Did you hear what I said?
  - I want to document my trip to America.
- - Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
  - Don't speak Russian!
  - Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
  - Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now
    speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown
    out!
- - Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night
    vision.
  - We have no money.  Come on.
- - Turn that off!  Get the bags.
  - Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
  - For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of
    my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
- - What?
  - Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
- - Turn that fucking thing off!
  - I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
- - Speak English!
  - You said speak Czech!
  - How you erase this?
  - I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
- - Whore?
  - I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
- - Get in the bathroom!
  - Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
  - Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
- - Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD
    MAN.
  - Shut up.
  - Does it hurt?
- - Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
  - Don't want to film this?
- - What is it?
  - The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
  - I did.
  - And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I
    won't be angry.
  - Why not?
  - Put the camera down, Oleg.
- - What is that?
  - What does it look like?  It's an address book!
- - Let me get a shot of it.
  - Sit down!
  - This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
- - No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill
    someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what
    good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended
    to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because
    of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy
    law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
  - Good idea!
- - Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
  - Cut!
- - You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
  - Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I
    gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
- - In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
  - The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
- - I'm serious.
  - Shut up.  Look!
- - This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent.
    You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
  - Bad last moment - I cut it out.
- - I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
  - Be quiet.  Watch.
- - Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
  - Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my
    talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
  - Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
- - I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And
    I want my credit.
  - Credit?
  - Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going
    to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
  - Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't
    share credit.
- - You got that?
  - No, I don't get that!
  - You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of
    shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
- - Traitor!!
  - No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
- - Who is he?
  - New York's finest.  This is his case.
- - This all you want?
  - Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
  - In here, says he wants a million.
  - Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
  - Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And
    how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to
    her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine
    or not?
  - Yes.  Both.
- - Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
  - Yes sir.
- - What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
  - Two weeks holiday.
  - How much money are you carrying with you?
  - I have five-hundred dollars.
  - Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
- - Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
  - Yes.
  - Please join us.  Come on forward.
  - Is there a problem?
  - No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
    you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
- - We are both from Prague.
  - How long are you planning to stay?
  - Two weeks.
  - I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
  - He doesn't speak English.
- - Hi, I'm Honey.
  - Where's Czech girl?
  - Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a
    Czech girl.
- - Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why
    don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
  - I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
- - It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't
    you gonna get undressed?
  - Where is escort service?
  - That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
  - I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
  - Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna
    make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't
    miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
- - Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
  - Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my
    time.
- - Give me the address!!
  - Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
- - Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
  - My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
  - Tommy, take a walk.
- - You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never
    shot anybody in your life.
  - You'll be my first.
- - C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have
    the balls.
  - Get down on your knees.
- - Where's your partner?
  - The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
- - Tell him to put his gun down!
  - Let her go!  Let her go!!
  - If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
- - Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next
    film.
  - Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
  - No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
  - I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
  - We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred
    thousand dollars.
  - What?  It doesn't work that way.
  - If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
  - Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
  - Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
- - Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work
    do you do?
  - I am butcher.
  - You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
  - You stuff sausage in it.
  - And what do you do with the bones?
  - Dog food.
- - Are you married?
  - No.  Are you proposing?
- - So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy
    weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
    go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun
    let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my
    head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off
    and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've
    had my head blown off.
  - Jesus Christ.
- - Sooner or later that's everybody.
  - Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla
    articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one
    remembers me anymore.
  - I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
  - I'm not moody.
- - How old are your kids?
  - 'My kids?  Let''s see...Susan''s 15. Aundrea''s 9.  Don''t tell me you''re thinking
    about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this:
    Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you
    a better person, they make you whole...  It''s all true!  Before I had kids when
    friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right,
    Leon?'
- - So what's unique?
  - Not what.  Who.
- - He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on.
    they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
  - That's unique.
  - Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
- - I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
  - You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
- - Ready?
  - Keep them out of my way.
  - Okay.  You ready?
  - Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
- - Any chance we can do that again?
  - Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
- - Detective, does it look like a murder?
  - We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
  - How many victims are up there?
  - There are two bodies found at this point.
  - Can we go up to the crime scene?
  - You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
  - Is it drug related?
  - We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
- - Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
  - I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
- - I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this
    somehow related to the fire department?
  - I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
  - Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is
    that correct?
  - He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
  - Do you have the suspect in custody?
  - Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've
    got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
  - Alright, cut, cut, cut.
- - Eddie, are you okay?
  - Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
  - Alright.
  - Alright?
  - Alright.
  - Alright.
  - Okay.
- - Hey, honey.
  - Hey.
- - What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
  - I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
  - You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me
    something.
  - Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
  - Stop it.
  - Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we
    just work something out?
  - Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
  - I'm not.
  - Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in
    your face.  You could give me something.
  - Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
  - That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
  - You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
  - Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
  - You're ruthless.
  - You're not so bad yourself.
- - Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
  - Could be Leon's.
  - Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going
    to do with you?
- - Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
  - Answer the phone.
  - No.  Tell me what you want to say.
  - Answer it.
  - Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's
    an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
- - Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
  - That's good.
  - Yeah.
  - Well, that's great.
  - Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
  - No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
  - No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know,
    the shoe thing and the marriages and...
  - I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll
    talk.
  - Promise?
  - I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine
    that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
  - Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
  - Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
  - I love you.
- - Okay, til tonight.
  - Tonight.
  - You promise?
  - Yeah.  I promise.
  - Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
    and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good
    thing.
  - Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
  - Okay.
  - See you later.  Good luck.
  - Thank you.
  - Don't be late.
- - So...who's Nicky?
  - What do you want?
  - Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And
    write books.
  - What's your accomplishment.
  - I kill someone famous.
  - Then do it, asshole.
  - Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
- - So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this
    time.
  - If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
- - You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin'
    stupid are you?
  - Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only
    will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming,
    would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her
    now?
- - Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
    through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
  - No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
- - You know what that is, right?
  - No, what is it?
  - Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the
    floor?
- - It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
  - Watch the news?
  - Nah, I musta missed it.
  - Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
  - Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
  - Nah, why should you?
  - I don't even watch TV.
  - Good.  Good.  Commendable.
- - Did you get a report from the M.E.?
  - Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
  - If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What
    about the report?
  - You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so
    hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an
    indicator of something personal.
- - The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
  - Pretty.
  - Hmmmm.
  - Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
  - Who says she's a suspect?
- - What would you call her?
  - Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after
    the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting
    somebody here.  Who knows?
- - Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are
    taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning
    them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
  - Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
  - Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians
    for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
- - I'll come with you.
  - There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
  - I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
  - This isn't homicide school.
  - My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
  - You're Polish?
  - My folks are.
  - Stay here.
- - You goin' to the escort service?
  - You got any better ideas?
  - Mind if I ride along with you?
  - This has nothing to do with your fire.
  - But what if it does?  You might need my help.
- - I'll let you know what happens.
  - This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
  - Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you
    don't win, you don't come.
  - I'll call it... tails.
- - Two heads.
  - Better than one.
- - Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
  - I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be
    there already.
- - You thirsty?
  - I'm on duty.
  - So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
  - Of course.
  - Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to
    a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd
    you dream about?
  - I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke
    and save a kid.
  - Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning
    building I'll gladly let you go first.
- - What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
  - She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
  - Is that all there is?
- - Why not?
  - Something back home?
- - She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
  - Raw deal.
- - Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have
    a first crack at her.
  - You wanna talk to her alone?
  - Yeah.
  - What would your girlfriend think of that?
  - I don't have a girlfriend.
  - My point exactly.
  - I'm serious here.
  - So am I.
  - C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
  - You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
  - You know what I'm saying here.
- - Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station
    house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
  - Hey.  I'm a professional.
  - Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
- - Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
  - Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
  - I took her there for a shower and that's it.
  - Just a shower?
- - Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably
    think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
  - No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean,
    to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's
    got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass
    at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make
    one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
  - I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think
    she's innocent.
  - Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand,
    that's why you're a professional.
  - But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda
    heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
  - How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration
    lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help
    her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your
    career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another
    piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret
    - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they
    know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that
    I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because
    of it.
- - Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
  - You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have.
    He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
- - Who's there?
  - Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
  - I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
  - Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
- - What's wrong?
  - We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the
    King Edward Hotel.
  - Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
- - Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once
    they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor
    girl...
  - Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
  - No.
  - Did you tell him you did?
- - Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
  - What are you saying?
  - Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
- - He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
  - Describe him.
  - Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's
    build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
  - He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
  - She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
- - Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
  - Vodka tonic.
  - Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
- - It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
  - What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week
    - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver
    there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin'
    a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and
    shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm
    thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
- - I'm gonna propose.
  - When?
  - Tomorrow.  At lunch.
  - You ready?
- - What's he looking for?
  - A timer.
- - Where is she?
  - Takin' a bath.
  - Any I.D.?
  - Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
- - Sorry...PD only.
  - It's okay.
- - Only one guys checked in?
  - Yeah.
  - C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
- - The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put
    her in the car.  Stay this side.
  - Stay with her.
- - Are you hit?
  - No.  I'm okay.
- - He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
  - I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
- - Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more
    money I get to pay you guys overtime.
  - Yeah, right.
  - What was that, Korfin?
  - I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
    alert the media.
  - You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
- - Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
  - Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
  - Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight
    to Hoover Street.  You got that?
  - Yeah.
- - Who did cause and origin?
  - Who do you think, Chief?!
  - Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
  - '''Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.'
- - Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
  - I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I
    wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return
    my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
- - Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned
    up.
  - What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
  - I let her take a shower.
  - A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
  - No!  Nothing happened.
  - Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your
    partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much
    trouble gettin' dates?!
- - Chief - mind if I take her?
  - Okay.  But not water sports.
- - The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our
    image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
  - What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back
    - I just forgot.
  - Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
  - Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
  - Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
  - End my career?
  - How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been
    on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have
    the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions
    based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
  - But Chief?  Over this??
  - There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your
    trial.
- - Oh.
  - It was my decision, not his.
  - Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be
    included in decisions.
  - Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that?
    The case is all yours.
  - Oh yeah...?  Alright.
  - I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
  - Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
- - I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
  - C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
  - Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
  - Go on.
- - Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
  - If I tell you, will you arrest me?
  - Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
- - Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They
    won't deport you.
  - No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
- - A cop?
  - I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right,
    a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
  - Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here.
    Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
  - You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
- - '...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was
    raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.'
  - Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
  - Yes, but he was a cop.
- - Now I become custody of police department?
  - If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
  - I will if they don't send me back.
  - They won't until this is over.
- - Are you married?
  - Divorced.
  - Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we
    stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
- - I can't take you to my place.
  - Somewhere else?
- - The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
  - So...the station is empty?
  - Yeah.  This way.
- - You considered becoming a prostitute?
  - Yes, I considered it.
  - Did you ever turn tricks before?
  - No.
  - What about back home?
  - No.
- - I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you
    have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a
    lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the
    table at Ludwig's.
  - So you were never a prostitute?
  - What are you asking me?
  - I'm just trying to find out who you are.
- - I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
  - I know.
  - You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can
    you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
  - They're not gonna send you right back.
  - I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this
    time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that
    someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
- - Are you alright?
  - I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
  - I'm sorry.
- - Is he your boyfriend?
  - Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
  - If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
  - If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going
    to jail ten-thousand miles away.
- - A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
  - No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
  - I'm glad I met you.
- - You better get packed.
  - Right.
- - Do you have coffee?
  - In the kitchen.
  - I'll make some for us.
  - I'll get my clothes.
- - What are you doing?
  - Pouring it out!
- - Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
  - '...Do you really want me to forget about you?'
  - I don't want to drag you down with me.
  - Daphne, I...
- - Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
  - I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
  - Here.  I have your money.
- - Oh no!  No!  Shit!
  - Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you
    looking for?
  - He has the camera!  He took the movie!
- - Don't say anything.
  - Where are we going?
  - I'm coming with you.
  - Yes.  Yes, come with me!
  - I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
- - I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to
    buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
  - You bring the cigarettes?
  - Oh, sure.
- - '...delusions and paranoia.'
  - I was all of these.
  - Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about
    that.
  - What about Oleg?
  - Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
  - No, he is here.  Shit...
  - Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
  - What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
  - Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
  - What's your cut?  How much?
  - I would say...half.  Half is fair.
  - No.  No way.
  - But it's...
  - Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case
    of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
  - This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
  - What else do you need?
  - I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why
    you're here.
  - Give me another one, please.
- - Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were
    like.
  - My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
  - Your mother was blind?
  - Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor
    to induce me.
  - Back in the Czech Republic?
  - Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father
    blamed me for her blindness...
  - Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
  - Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette
    out?
- - That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
  - Your father put cigarettes out on you?
  - Out on my back when I was a small boy.
  - Can I see your back?
- - I'm abused.  Don't you think?
  - I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
- - '...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...'
  - Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
- - Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
  - Yes, Your Majesty.
- - You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
  - Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
- - '... Into a monk...'
  - Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
- - Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new
    world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
  - We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must
    give time for time.
- - '... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...'
  - Is this true, Brother Buyl?
- - Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
  - He must be replaced.
  - And who would you think of, for such a task?
- - I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
  - Then why?
  - Because he is not afraid of me.
- - Where can I meet this man?
  - Immediately.
- - You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
  - Six days ago, yes.
  - You must be mad...!
  - We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
  - We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
  - You think I don't know that?
  - We're lost!
  - The land is there.  I know it!
  - You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling
    you we're turning back!
  - And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know
    that!
  - Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
  - You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
  - You bloody...
  - Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
  - You tell that to them!
  - You're right.  Let the men decide.
- - Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
  - God be with us admiral.
- - Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost
    sight from land days ago...
  - And what do you think Mendez?
  - Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night
    before.
  - Come over here.
- - What do you read?
  - Twenty eight.
- - What's he doing?
  - He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
  - We can't be.
- - And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure
    that would make this a sin.
  - The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
- - We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
  - If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
- - You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will
    you kill?  Which tribe?
  - We don't need to know.
  - We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there
    is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our
    grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
- - We can't raise the wheel without it.
  - My horse doesn't work.
- - Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
  - You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
- - In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each
    other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
  - Savagery is what monkeys understand.
  - You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until
    you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
  - You will regret this.
- - I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel
    tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not
    a fool.
  - No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
- - The ocean is uncrossable?
  - What did they say about Granada before today?
  - That she was impregnable.
- - I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
  - Surely you can do anything you want.
- - May I speak freely?
  - You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
  - I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's
    not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
  - A woman?
- - How old are you, Senor Colon?
  - Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
- - Do they have such thoughts?
  - They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
- - But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the
    other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
  - Thank you.
  - There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after
    all this?
  - Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with
    my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
- - Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should
    be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
  - Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I
    would have chosen for myself.
- - God... That's in a week!
  - That's what it says.
  - How did you manage it?
  - With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
- - Why do you wish to sail west?
  - To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching
    it...
- - How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
  - Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary
    Islands.
  - How can you be so certain?
  - The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
  - Esdras is a Jew.
  - So was Christ!
- - Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you,
    Colon.
  - I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
  - Father Marchena!
  - Passion is something one cannot control!
  - You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
  - I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
  - Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
- - You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
  - Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
  - If God intends you to go, then you will go.
  - Damn God!
- - Colon!
  - Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the
    safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell
    me something I can listen to!
- - All of them!  Just lies!
  - Colon!  Don't!
- - In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
  - Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
- - I am listening, my son.
  - Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
  - What are you saying?
  - I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
  - How long?
  - I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
- - May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
  - If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You
    trust me...
  - My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher,
    you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
  - You are bound by an oath, Father.
- - I believed in you...
  - Give me absolution.
- - I suppose we're both old men now.
  - You'll always be older than me, Father.
- - I have to disagree.
  - I knew you would.
  - New worlds create new people.
  - Oh?  So you are a new man?
  - I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still
    can't accept the world as it is!
- - Say not here!  Cuba!
  - What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
  - Island.  Far.
- - You come!  You speak first!
  - Tell the Chief we thank him.
  - Chief knows.
  - Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to
    build a fort.
- - Chief says -- how many?
  - Thousands.
  - Why?
- - To bring the word of God.
  - Chief says -- he has a God.
  - '... and also to bring medicine.'
  - Chief says...
  - He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
- - We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
  - He understands.
  - Ask him if he will help.
- - You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
  - You did the same to your God!
- - Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
  - You never learned how to speak my language.
- - No...
  - No?
  - NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all
    the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
- - I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
  - I'm not bargaining!
  - Then you are too ambitious.
- - And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among
    the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
  - If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
- - They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never
    ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits.
    And...
  - Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
- - You defend yourself admirably...
  - '... for a commoner?'
- - But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
  - Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
  - Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
- - You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
  - What...?  Do I have so many already?
  - To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy
    goes a long way.
- - All I have to do is call the guards.
  - Call them.
- - I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
  - Look out of that window.
- - What do you see?
  - Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
  - All of them created by people like me.
- - I want to go with you!
  - There'll be a time.
  - You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
- - Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
  - Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
- - I have to explore the mainland.
  - This time with me!
- - How are you feeling, Fernando?
  - Not bad.
- - Father...
  - There must be a passage to that other ocean.
- - What are you listening to?
  - I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
- - What does he say?
  - He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
  - He never had one... except aboard my ships!
- - I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
  - Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
  - Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
- - I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it
    not so?
  - Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
  - May I ask by whom?
  - Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
- - Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
  - Yes... I remember...
- - My letters of appointment.
  - Appointment to what?
  - Viceroy of the West Indies.
  - Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
- - How far from here?
  - I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you
    are not too disappointed.
  - How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
  - I am afraid this is not the worst news.
- - I could be gone for years.
  - I know.
  - I haven't given you much of a life.
  - Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always
    leaving...
  - Are we going to argue?
  - I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
- - Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
  - I find that hard to believe.
- - She said yes.
  - Thank God...
- - I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
  - I don't want you to wait for me.
  - That's something you can't decide.
- - Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
  - You don't usually ask.
  - I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
- - God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away
    from me...
  - They tried... but I didn't let them.
- - They took everything...
  - Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make
    a man rich, they only make him busier...
- - Can't you stay with us a little?
  - I am busy inside.
- - What is it, now?  Tell me...
  - I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I
    didn't spend with you.
- - The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
  - The Judgment is ours!
  - Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity
    for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
- - He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of
    his absurd notions?
  - Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them,
    when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
- - It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
  - On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
- - You can see for yourself.
  - What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
  - A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever
    remembered -- it will only be because of his.
- - You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
  - Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
  - Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are
    you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
  - I am, Your Eminence
  - Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference
    of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean...
    uncrossable.
- - Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern
    with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who
    would have relied upon our judgment.
  - Excellency, you are right.
- - Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make
    the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
  - Your life, and that of others!
  - If they agree to follow me, yes.
- - Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one
    of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
  - Is that all that interests you? Gold?
  - No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will
    find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
- - If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for
    you to show it to the world?
  - Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
- - Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
  - Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
- - Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
  - IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
- - I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
  - The water's going putrid in the barrels.
  - You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
- - What are you listening to, chicken ass?
  - Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
  - With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
- - He's the devil's child...
  - We'll all go crazy...
- - We should have seen land.
  - We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
  - Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells
    like a cunt. Bad sign...
- - In the microwave.
  - Make anyone cry today?
- - What's a synonym for throbbing?
  - Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
- - Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
  - Tumescent!
  - You're not helping.
- - Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
  - Pirate -- no question.
- - They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
  - Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my
    elbows in placenta all day.
- - What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
  - Dr. Ruth?
- - Have a great time, honey!
  - But -- who -- what --?
- - What just happened?
  - Your daughters went to the prom.
  - Did I have anything to say about it?
  - Absolutely not.
  - That ' s what I thought
- - I missed you.
  - It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
  - It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
  - With the teeth of your zipper?
- - I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are
    you not feeling well?
  - Touch of the flu.
  - I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
- - Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
  - What's to discuss?
  - You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly
    psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
  - Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package
    is pretty good...
- - You're completely demented.
  - See you next week!
- - Say it
  - What?
  - Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
- - What plan?
  - The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
  - What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
- - I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than
    say -- Joey Dorsey's.
  - Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
- - That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
  - So Dorsey can get the girl?
  - Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set
    this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
- - You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
  - We're your guys.
- - What?!
  - Good enough.
- - Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
  - Just for now.
- - Ever been to Club Skunk?
  - Yeah.
- - I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
  - I'm likin' you guys better
- - So you got cozy with she who stings?
  - No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
- - You were right. She's still pissed.
  - Sweet love, renew thy force!
  - Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
- - Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
  - Hi.
  - Cool pictures.  You a fan?
  - Yeah.  I guess.
- - You think?
  - Oh yeah.
- - Macbeth, right?
  - Right.
  - Kat a fan, too?
  - Yeah...
- - Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
  - Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
  - Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events
    are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite
    well, in case you're interested.
  - I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
  - The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
- - Tempestuous?
  - No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
- - Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think
    about it?
  - Just smack her now.
- - I know.
  - I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
  - You decided.
- - This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
  - Enough!
- - My insurance does not cover PMS
  - Then tell them I had a seizure.
  - Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
  - I thought you were punishing me.
  - Why can't we agree on this?
  - Because you're making decisions for me.
  - As a parent, that's my right
  - So what I want doesn't matter?
  - You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five
    and you don't have it.
  - I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I
    want --
- - Was that your sister?
  - Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
  - Funny.
- - I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should
    be hip to?
  - No, Daddy.
  - So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
  - Parts of it.
  - Which parts?
  - The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
  - Bianca did what?
  - What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
  - No -- impressed.
- - You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running
    their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play
    a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah
    Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
  - When I go?
  - Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
- - I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
  - Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
  - There's a way to get a guy's attention.
  - My mission in life.
- - Pick you up Friday, then
  - Oh, right.  Friday.
- - The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
  - Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
  - I know a lot more than that
- - You hate me don't you?
  - I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
  - Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
  - And why would I do that?
  - Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my
    hand on your ass...
  - You -- covered in my vomit.
  - Seven-thirty?
- - Are you following me?
  - I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
  - Hi
- - You're not a big talker, are you?
  - Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
- - hey.  Great show, huh?
  - ''
- - Excuse me?
  - That's what you want, isn't it?
  - Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
- - You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up
    there.
  - You know who The Raincoats are?
  - Why, don't you?
- - What's this?
  - '"I''m getting trashed, man." Isn''t that what you''re supposed to do at a party?'
  - I say, do what you wanna do.
  - Funny, you're the only one
- - Okay?
  - I'm fine. I'm
- - You're not okay.
  - I just need to lie down for awhile
  - Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
  - I know, just let me sleep
  - What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke
    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
- - This is so patronizing.
  - Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
  - Why 're you doing this?
  - I told you
  - You don't care if I die
  - Sure, I do
  - Why?
  - Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
  - Like you could find one
  - See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
  - Just let me sit down.
- - Why'd you let him get to you?
  - Who?
  - Dorsey.
  - I hate him.
  - I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You
    don't seem like the type.
  - Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid
    back" like everyone else?
  - I thought you were above all that
  - You know what they say
- - Kat! Wake up!
  - What?
- - And I'm in control of it.
  - But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
- - When you were gone last year -- where were you?
  - Busy
  - Were you in jail?
  - Maybe.
  - No, you weren't
  - Then why'd you ask?
  - Why'd you lie?
- - I should do this.
  - Do what?
  - This.
- - Start a band?
  - My father wouldn't approve of that that
  - You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
- - Oh, so now you think you know me?
  - I'm gettin' there
- - So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
  - He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
  - Who?
  - BIANCA
  - No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all,
    but ...
- - Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
  - What are you doing here?
  - I heard there was a poetry reading.
  - You 're so --
  - Pleasant?
- - Wholesome.
  - Unwelcome.
  - Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
  - Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
  - So what did I have an effect on ?
  - Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
- - He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
  - Look up, sunshine
- - I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
  - C'mon.  It's not that bad
  - Try lookin' at it from this angle
- - Put your right foot there --
  - Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
  - You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
  - Maybe.
- - The Partridge Family?
  - I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you
    off.
  - Good call.
  - So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
  - I dazzled him with my wit
- - A soft side? Who knew?
  - Yeah, well, don't let it get out
  - So what's your excuse?
  - Acting the way we do.
  - 'Yes'
  - I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they
    get disappointed when you change.
  - So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
  - Something like that
  - Then you screwed up
  - How?
  - You never disappointed me.
- - You up for it?
  - For. . . ?
- - State trooper?
  - Fallacy.
  - The duck?
  - Hearsay.
  - I know the porn career's a lie.
- - Tell me something true.
  - I hate peas.
  - No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
  - You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
  - What?
  - No one else knows
  - You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
  - Go to the prom with me
- - Is that a request or a command?
  - You know what I mean
  - No.
  - No what?
  - No, I won't go with you
  - Why not?
  - Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
- - Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
  - So I have to have a motive to be with you?
  - You tell me.
  - You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
  - Answer the question, Patrick
  - Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
- - How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
  - It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
  - It's just something I had.  You know
  - Oh huh
  - Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
- - My grandmother's .
  - What?
  - That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died
    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've
    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the
    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
- - That ' s completely adorable!
  - It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
- - Wait I...
  - You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was
    a set-up!
  - It wasn't like that.
  - Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with
    me?
  - I didn't care about the money.
- - A Fender Strat. You bought this?
  - I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
- - Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great
    girl.
  - Is that right?
  - Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
- - Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
  - Because I like to torture you.
  - Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
  - Don ' t you even dare. . .
- - Who's that?
  - Patrick Verona   Random skid.
  - That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn
    movies.
  - I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
  - He always look so
  - Block E?
- - Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
  - Just a little.
- - What's this?
  - An attempted slit.
- - I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing
    yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal
    teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering
    the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
  - But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
- - The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
  - You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
- - So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his
    male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at
    all.
  - William would never have gone to a state school.
  - William didn't even go to high school
  - That's never been proven
  - Neither has his heterosexuality.
- - I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
  - Does it matter?
  - If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your
    tiara."
- - You think this'll work?
  - No fear.
- - What'd he say?
  - Who cares?
- - You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social
    activity.
  - I didn't have a choice.
  - You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
  - I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
  - You didn't
  - I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
- - Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
  - Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
  - Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking
    Veronica.
  - Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
  - You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
  - Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
- - Have you seen him?
  - Who?
  - William - he asked me to meet him here.
  - Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
- - Hey.
  - Are you lost?
  - Nope - just came by to chat
  - We don't chat.
  - Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're
    interested.
  - We're not.
- - But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and
    no one will go out with her. right?
  - Does this conversation have a purpose?
  - So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's
    up for the job.
- - I hear you're helpin' Verona.
  - Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
  - You and Verona?
  - What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
- - You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
  - Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
- - Yeah
  - What do you think?
- - Two legs, nice rack...
  - Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
  - Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
  - You just said
  - You need money to take a girl out
  - But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
- - You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
  - You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
  - I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.
    She doesn't want a boyfriend.
  - How much?
- - I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
  - Fine, thirty.
- - Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
  - Fifty, and you've got your man.
- - When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
  - I'm on it
  - Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
  - I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
- - I just upped my price
  - What?
  - A hundred bucks a date.
  - Forget it.
  - Forget her sister, then.
- - It's about time.
  - A deal's a deal.
- - How'd you do it?
  - Do what?
  - Get her to act like a human
- - I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
  - Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
- - The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
  - Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was
    your elbow.  Tough break.
  - They're running the rest of me next month.
- - Hey -- do you mind?
  - Not at all
- - Where ya goin?
  - Away.
  - Your sister here?
- - Leave my sister alone.
  - And why would I do that?
- - And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
  - Yeah -- we'll see.
- - What've you got for me?
  - I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think
    you'll find helpful.
- - 'Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the
    indie-rock persuasion".'
  - So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and
    sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
- - Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
  - Don't make me do it, man
- - Cameron, I'm a little busy
  - It's off. The whole thing.
- - What 're you talking about?
  - She's partial to Joey, not me
- - Cameron -- do you like the girl?
  - Sure
  - Then, go get her
- - What'd you do to her?
  - I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember
    it.
- - She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
  - She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
- - You makin' any headway?
  - She kissed me.
  - Where?
- - What's the worst?
  - You get the girl.
- - You the new guy?
  - So they tell me...
  - C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
- - So -- which Dakota you from?
  - North, actually.  How'd you   ?
  - I was kidding. People actually live there?
  - Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
  - How many people were in your old school?
  - Thirty-two.
  - Get out!
  - How many people go here?
  - Couple thousand. Most of them evil
- - That I'm used to.
  - Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
- - That girl -- I --
  - You burn, you pine, you perish?
  - Who is she?
  - Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
  - Why not?
  - I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to
    date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
- - Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
  - Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers
    before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
  - He always have that shit-eating grin?
  - Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number
    twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to
    have a big tube sock ad coming out.
- - You know French?
  - Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
  - Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
  - You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
  - You could consecrate with her, my friend.
- - Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
  - That's her?  Bianca's sister?
  - The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
- - I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love
    with me.
  - Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
- - What about him?
  - You wanna go out with him?
- - What makes you think he'll do it?
  - He seems like he thrives on danger
  - No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just
    got out of Alcatraz...
  - They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
  - I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so
    he could buy new speakers.
  - Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
  - Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
  - That's what I just said
- - You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.
    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
  - I thought you hated those people.
  - Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
- - You got him involved?
  - Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating
    the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the
    shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
- - This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
  - In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
  - Will Bogey get bent?
  - Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
- - Number one.  She hates smokers
  - It's a lung cancer issue
  - Her favorite uncle
  - Dead at forty-one.
- - He's pretty!
  - Okay!  I wasn't sure
- - Assail your ears for one night.
  - It's her favorite band.
- - You told me that part already.
  - Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
- - Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
  - The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away
    while you're talking to her?
  - Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
  - No, I ' m not.
- - You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even
    the score.
  - Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
- - Always a pleasure, Brucie.
  - Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen
    belly-button ring for you?
  - Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
  - Never
  - Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
  - Just sent 'em through.
- - Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
  - No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
  - What if she never starts dating?
  - Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
  - But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
- - But she doesn't want to date.
  - Exactly my point
- - Daddy, I --
  - And where're you going?
  - If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
  - Otherwise known as an orgy?
  - It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem"
    over there isn't going --
- - Daddy, people expect me to be there!
  - If Kat's not going, you're not going.
- - Oh, God.  It's starting.
  - It's just a party. Daddy.
- - Wear the belly before you go.
  - Daddy, no!
  - Just for a minute
- - Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
  - Why?
  - Because she'll scare them away.
- - Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
  - The prom?  Kat has a date?
  - No, but
  - It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
  - He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
  - You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
  - Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
- - I'm missing something.
  - I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we
    know.
- - Where've you been?
  - Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
- - I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
  - Can you at least start wearing a bra?
- - Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
  - It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
  - Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but
    are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
  - What do you think?
  - I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
- - You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
  - What's normal?
  - Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who
    Need Prozac to know that.
- - Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
  - At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
- - Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
  - It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
  - Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed
    to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
- - You are so completely unbalanced.
  - Can we go now?
- - Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
  - I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
- - I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go
    totally apeshit when you get here.
  - You're welcome.
- - Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
  - Like you care.
  - I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not
    someone else ' s .
  - I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and
    I can't go, because you won ' t.
- - Joey never told you we went out, did he?
  - What?
  - In 9th.  For a month
  - Why?
  - He was, like, a total babe
  - But you hate Joey
  - Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
  - As in...
- - He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
  - You did what?
  - Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.
    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
- - But
  - After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing
    it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal
    display --
  - Why didn't you tell me?
  - I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
  - No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've
    let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
- - That's not
  - I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
  - I guess I thought I was protecting you.
  - God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience
    anything for myself
  - Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want
    to.
  - I guess I'll never know, will I?
- - You looked beautiful last night, you know.
  - So did you
- - Let go!
  - You set me up.
  - I just wanted --
  - What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
  - No! I just wanted
- - Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
  - It's just you.
- - Patrick -- is that- a.
  - Perm?
- - It's more
  - Expensive?
- - Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
  - Hopefully.
- - So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's
    gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
  - Queen Harry?
  - It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
- - Neat...
  - My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
- - Hey, sweet cheeks.
  - Hi, Joey.
  - You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
- - Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
  - You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
- - Did you change your hair?
  - No.
  - You might wanna think about it
- - Where did he go?  He was just here.
  - Who?
  - Joey.
- - Great
  - Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
- - He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean.
    Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
  - Is he oily or dry?
  - Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
- - Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include
    door-opening and coat-holding.
  - Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones
    we actually want to go out with, you know?
  - All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
- - I have to be home in twenty minutes.
  - I don't have to be home 'til two.
- - You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
  - I did.
- - Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly
    horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
  - Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
  - Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
  - Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
- - You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
  - Forget it.
- - No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
  - Cameron.
  - The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My
    sister.  I can't date until she does.
  - Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
- - Why?
  - Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school,
    then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
  - That's a shame.
- - Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
  - Let me see what I can do.
- - C'esc ma tete. This is my head
  - Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
  - I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like
    where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I
    have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
  - That's because it's such a nice one.
  - Forget French.
- - How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
  - Well, there's someone I think might be --
- - There.
  - Where?
- - You got something on your mind?
  - I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't
    we ever going on our date?
- - You have my word.  As a gentleman
  - You're sweet.
- - How do you get your hair to look like that?
  - Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without
    the diffuser attachment.
- - Sure have.
  - I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
  - I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
- - She's not a...
  - Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty
    sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
  - So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
  - Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy
    that smokes.
- - Hi.
  - Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
- - You know Chastity?
  - I believe we share an art instructor
- - Have fun tonight?
  - Tons
- - I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
  - I was?
  - You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
- - Well, no...
  - Then that's all you had to say.
  - But
  - You always been this selfish?
- - Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on
    90210."
  - No...
- - do you listen to this crap?
  - What crap?
  - Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
  - Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
- - I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
  - What good stuff?
  - The "real you".
  - Like my fear of wearing pastels?
- - I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you
    don't know how to quit?
  - 'No'
  - Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
- - Wow
  - Let's go.
- - She okay?
  - I hope so.
- - They do to!
  - They do not!
